       "   'have enabled these arbitrages to exist and persist If these apparent arbitrages opportunities are made possible by macro-prudential regulations, does that imply that there is something wrong with the regulations? More generally, what can be learned from the patterns of arbitrage across assets induced by regulation? Can we use these patterns to assess whether macro-prudential regulations are having their intended effects? Suppose we observe the price of an asset a that is traded by both intermediaries and households, and the price of another asset a′ with identical payoffs that is traded by intermediaries only If the prices of a and a′ are not equal, an apparent arbitrage exists Such an opportunity can exist in equilibrium if intermediaries are bound by a constraint that treats a and a′ differently (say, because it treats derivatives and cash assets differently) Let us further suppose that this constraint exists because of regulation– it is a leverage constraint, capital control, or some other kind of policy Now imagine that a household approaches an intermediary and wishes to buy asset a The intermediary contemplates selling asset a to the household and hedging by purchasing asset a′ If the price of a is higher than the price of a′, this arbitrage trade is proﬁtable the intermediary would execute the trade if unconstrained From this we can infer, as outside observers, that regulation is constraining the extent to which the intermediary can sell the asset a to the household That is, the regulation 1 is keeping the risks associated with asset a within the intermediary sector instead of allowing those risks to be transferred to the household sector We can then adopt a macro-prudential',\n",
       "   'instead of allowing those risks to be transferred to the household sector We can then adopt a macro-prudential viewpoint and ask whether or not it is desirable, from a social perspective, to shift the holdings of asset a from households to intermediaries In this paper I develop a formal, multi-asset version of the argument above The procedure I develop takes the form of a revealed preference exercise I ask what externalities would justify the distortions in risk-sharing I infer from various arbitrage opportunities? Equivalently, what risks are pushed by regulation into the intermediary sector and what risks are pushed by regulation into the household sector? The key step in the analysis is the construction of what I call the “externality-mimicking portfolio ” This portfolio’s returns are an estimate of the externalities that would justify the observed patterns of arbitrage, or equivalently an estimate of the effect of regulation on risk-sharing between households and intermediaries I construct this portfolio using CIP violations In the context of CIP violations, the assets a and a′ are combinations of bond and exchange rate transactions Empirically, the sign of the observed arbitrage, as documented by Du et al (2018), is related to the direction of the carry trade– it is more expensive for the household to execute the carry trade than it is for the intermediary to replicate the carry trade using currency forwards Consequently, I infer that the relevant regulatory constraint(s) have the effect of keeping carry trade risk within the intermediary sector, instead of allowing intermediaries to transfer those risks to households This result is surprising given the risky nature of the carry trade The basic issue is',\n",
       "   'to households This result is surprising given the risky nature of the carry trade The basic issue is that some CIP violations (e g AUD-USD and JPY-USD) have the wrong sign That is, because JPY appreciates and AUD depreciates vs 2 USD in bad times, optimal policy should encourage intermediaries to be long JPY and short AUD (i e short the carry trade) But the signs of the CIP violations are such that they encourage intermediaries to be long the carry trade, taking on more macro-economic risk I speculate that this issue arises from an interaction between leverage constraints (which do not consider the “sign” of a trade) and demand from customers, as suggested by Du et al (2018) This conclusion does not rely on speciﬁc assumptions about which regulations are binding in the case of CIP violations This is desirable in light of the “alphabet soup” of potentially relevant post-crisis regulations 1 That is, the methodology developed in this paper is relatively model-agnostic and does not require strong assumptions about the nature of the relevant regulation in contrast, the traditional approach of using a fully speciﬁed model necessarily involves such assumptions The procedure I develop has two key limitations First, it assumes that the arbitrages under consideration are caused by regulation The “anomalies” described by Lamont and Thaler (2003) are violations of the law of one price between long-lived assets, and can become larger before converging Non-regulatory limits to arbitrage (as in Shleifer and Vishny (1997)) might prevent intermediaries from eliminating these anomalies For this reason, I restrict my empirical analysis to short-dated arbitrages (with a one-month or shorter horizon) which were insigniﬁcant prior to the GFC Second,',\n",

       "   'is that the current regulatory apparatus is not accomplishing its macro-prudential objectives 42 Du et al (2018) shows that the direction of the CIP arbitrage across currencies is predicted by the direction of the carry trade A simple interpretation of this fact is that households or their proxies want to do the carry trade, and intermediaries are induced by the arbitrage to take the other side Leverage constraints, such as the “supplementary leverage ratio,” prevent the intermediaries from fully satisfying households’ demands If this story is correct, households are trying to take macro-economic risk and insure intermediaries from those risks, but regulation (the leverage ratio) is limiting this risk transfer, which is the exact opposite of what an optimal policy would do Note that, under this interpretation, existing regulation does not by itself determine the sign of the arbitrage Instead, the sign of the arbitrage under existing regulations arises from the interaction of customer demands and regulatory constraints This, however, is a policy choice instead of encouraging intermediaries to take more carry trade risk, regulation could be redesigned so as to discourage intermediaries from taking carry trade risk For robustness, appendix section B presents three sets of additional results The ﬁrst set uses the physical measure externality-mimicking portfolio instead of the risk-neutral externality-mimicking portfolio in the stress test exercise The estimated physical and risk-neutral measure covariance matrices are similar, and the stress test results do not depend on the choice of reference measure See appendix sections A 2 and B 2 for details on the construction of the portfolio and the results The second set of results incorporates an equity-based arbitrage between the SPDR ETF and SPY',\n",

       "   'and invest enough cash at the IOER rate over the next month to cover the exercise price of the put/call Regardless of whether the ETF ends up above or below the strike price, the intermediary will end up owning the ETF in one month The particular details of this arbitrage are complicated by the fact that the SPY options are “American” and not “European” options, meaning they can be exercised at any time I deal with this issue by employing the Margrabe (1978) bound on American put prices, which in my setting (short time horizons and low interest rates) is reasonably tight I discuss this issue in more detail below The ETF and the replicating portfolio will generate identical payoffs as long as there are no dividends over the course of the month (more precisely, that an exdividend date does not occur within the month) The ETF has ex-dividend dates quarterly, usually on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December 40 40The prospectus, available at https //us spdrs com/librarycontent/public/SPDR 500%20TRUST PROSPECTUS pdf, describes the details of how the ex-dividend dates are determined 55 I therefore limit my sample to avoid these dates This illustrates one of the two main advantages the ETF-based arbitrage has over the traditional S P 500 cash-futures arbitrage The stocks of the S P 500 index pay dividends often, and hence most studies of index arbitrage assume either perfect foresight of dividends or use a dividend forecast, whereas no such assumptions are required for the ETF arbitrage The second advantage relates to transactions costs and stale prices The traditional index arbitrage involves buying and selling 500 stocks, generating substantial transactions costs and exacerbating the issue that prices might not be synchronized Using',\n",
       "   '500 stocks, generating substantial transactions costs and exacerbating the issue that prices might not be synchronized Using the ETF, which is one of the most actively traded securities in the equity market and has a very small bid-offer, mitigates many of these issues Of course, synchronizing the options prices and the ETF price is still critically important, as in Van Binsbergen et al (2012) For this arbitrage, I am assuming that the costs associated with posting margin on the options are negligible That is, the margin is sufﬁciently small, and the interest rate the intermediary receives on the posted margin sufﬁciently close to the IOER rate, that these costs are negligible This assumption is also, implicitly, being applied to the margin required by counterparties in the OTC market for FX swaps when studying CIP violations Because the SPY options are American, not European, I construct arbitrage bounds as opposed to a single arbitrage measure It is straightforward to observe that an American call or put must be weakly more valuable than its European counterpart, but the possibility of early exercise implies that this weak inequality might be strict Let pa(K) ∈A and ca(K) ∈A denote the American put and American call of 56 strike K Following the argument of Margrabe (1978), let ˆpa(K) be an American put option to exchange the ETF for an amount that grows at the IOER rate, K exp(t · ln(RI f )), where t is the time of the exchange Because the option matures prior to the next FOMC meeting, the IOER rate is assumed to be constant Because the intermediary is always indifferent between buying the ETF and the risk-free bond, there is',\n",

       "   '3 For instance, Bloom et al (2010) and Van Reenen (2011) show that managerial practices are affected by the competitive environment in which firms operate 6 (Adhvaryu et al , 2019) Third, it extends research on the way managerial quality affects the response of economic outcomes to shocks (Wang et al , 2016) by looking beyond the productivity dimension into the mechanisms that underlie these outcomes The finding that good management may contribute to smooth out the effect of deep crises on employment is potentially relevant for understanding differences in employment responses to the Covid crisis during lockdowns across countries, beyond influences exerted by other institutional arrangements such as reliance on job retention vs unemployment insurance schemes It could also be relevant looking forward to gauge the persisting effects of the Covid19 crisis on employment upon exiting confinement periods via the emergence of new work arrangements reflecting the need for social distancing While there are obvious differences between the causes and mechanisms underlying the Great Recession and the Covid-19 crises and the policy responses to these crises, our results suggest that good management could have positive effects in the recovery process of both crises through comparable channels In the following, we start by describing our empirical approach and regression',\n",

       "   'and quantifying their aggregate eﬀects remains a major challenge There are at least two reasons for this On the measurement side, it is common to attribute all – or much of – the crosssectional dispersion in the observed marginal returns to ﬁrms’ inputs to misallocation This creates upward bias in measures of misallocation and can contaminate estimates of diﬀerences in allocative eﬃciency across countries or over time 1 On the policy side, even if one were able to fully correct for mismeasurement and quantify the eﬀect of changes in misallocation on aggregate productivity, the speciﬁc sources of misallocation are diﬃcult to identify from aggregate comparisons 2 This leaves policymakers with limited information about what levers to pull to reduce misallocation In low-income countries, where there are likely to be large ﬁrm-level frictions in the allocation of resources, understanding which policies reduce domestic misallocation could provide policymakers with powerful tools to foster economic growth An unusual natural experiment in India allows us to make progress on both the measurement and the policy fronts, providing some of the ﬁrst evidence on a policy tool that can be used to reduce misallocation in aﬀected sectors 3 Over the 2000s, India introduced the automatic approval of foreign direct investments up to at least 1 Upward bias can come, for example, from measurement error (Bils, Klenow, and Ruane, 2018 Rotemberg and White, 2017 Gollin and Udry, 2021), model misspeciﬁcation (Haltiwanger, Kulick, and Syverson, 2018 Nishida, Petrin, Rotemberg, and White, 2017), volatility of productivity paired with the costly adjustment of inputs (Asker, Collard-Wexler, and De Loecker, 2014 Gollin and Udry, 2021), unobserved heterogeneity in technology (Gollin and Udry, 2021), and informational frictions and uncertainty (David, Hopenhayn,',\n",
       "   'and Udry, 2021), unobserved heterogeneity in technology (Gollin and Udry, 2021), and informational frictions and uncertainty (David, Hopenhayn, and Venkateswaran, 2016 David and Venkateswaran, 2019) 2 To quantify the overall degree of misallocation, the literature usually compares outcomes such as the distribution of marginal revenue products across units of production after controlling for diﬀerent observable characteristics and attributes the residual dispersion to misallocation Since this method of quantifying misallocation typically does not show which characteristics causally aﬀect the residual dispersion in marginal products, it is mostly silent on what policies would be required to reduce misallocation in low-income countries 3 For simplicity, throughout this paper we use the shorthands of “reducing misallocation” and “changing misallocation” to refer to changes in the misallocation of inputs among formal sector ﬁrms within manufacturing industries that were treated by the policy We cannot speak to the global eﬀects of the policy on misallocation, as this would require us to be able to observe the universe of ﬁrms and FDI worldwide 2 51% of domestic ﬁrms’ equity, potentially increasing overall access to capital while reducing capital market frictions Such a policy can aﬀect aggregate output for two reasons First, by increasing the overall amount of capital available, it allows the average ﬁrm to grow Second, it can change the distribution of capital across ﬁrms, which in the presence of heterogeneous ﬁrms, will aﬀect the degree of capital misallocation in treated industries and therefore, those industries’ aggregate productivity If the increased capital allows ﬁrms with high marginal returns to capital (“MRPK”) to grow relatively faster, the misallocation of capital will decrease as the within-industry dispersion in MRPK declines Using the staggered introduction of the policy across',\n",
       "   'will decrease as the within-industry dispersion in MRPK declines Using the staggered introduction of the policy across industries, we implement a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences framework to estimate the eﬀects of this foreign capital liberalization on both total capital and the distribution of capital across ﬁrms In the absence of a natural experiment, the measurement of changes in misallocation would be contaminated by measurement error and other (unobserved) shocks However, in this setting, the natural experiment allows us to isolate changes in inputs and the change in the marginal revenue product of capital due to the policy, allowing us to cleanly estimate how misallocation changes due to the policy The inclusion of various controls, such as ﬁrm, year, and 5-digit industry-year ﬁxed eﬀects, accounts for many sources of unobserved heterogeneity that could otherwise bias measurement A priori, the eﬀect of opening-up to foreign capital on domestic allocative eﬃciency is unclear On the one hand, in low-income countries, where formal credit markets are limited, opening up to foreign capital markets might reduce funding constraints if foreign investors have better screening technologies or are not bound by domestic historical, political, or regulatory constraints On the other hand, foreign investors may be worse at processing and monitoring soft information, particularly in lowincome countries, thereby worsening the allocation of capital 4 We ﬁnd that the liberalization of foreign capital increases total capital in treated industries while also reducing capital misallocation within those industries by increasing capital for the ﬁrms with the highest marginal revenue returns to capital prior to the reform This implies that at least some of the dispersion in observed marginal revenue products of capital in India is due to misallocation rather',\n",
       "   'of the dispersion in observed marginal revenue products of capital in India is due to misallocation rather than noise We then 4 In the context of foreign banks’ behavior in low-income countries, several studies have found that foreign banks mainly lend to large domestic ﬁrms, thereby potentially increasing credit constraints for local ﬁrms (e g , Detragiache, Tressel, and Gupta, 2008) 3 develop a method, based on the theoretical results of Petrin and Levinsohn (2012) and Baqaee and Farhi (2019), to translate our microeconomic estimates into more and less conservative measures of the eﬀect of the policy on the treated industries’ Solow residual (a proxy for these industries’ aggregate productivity) Our proposed method uses exogenous variation to generate a lower bound for the aggregate effect of changing misallocation on treated industries under relatively weak identifying assumptions To measure the eﬀects of the reform, we collected data on industry-level liberalization episodes in 2001 and 2006 Combining this policy variation with a panel of large and medium-sized Indian ﬁrms over the period 1995–2015, we investigate whether the reform reduced misallocation by testing whether the policy had diﬀerential effects depending on ﬁrms’ ex-ante marginal revenue products of capital (henceforth “MRPK”) Estimating whether the policy reduced misallocation does not require deregulation to be random, nor for ﬁrms to have similar levels of pre-reform covariates It only requires that, in the absence of the reform, high MRPK ﬁrms would not have grown relatively more quickly than low MRPK ﬁrms in treated vs untreated industries While fundamentally untestable, we provide three pieces of evidence to support this assumption First, we graphically show similar trends across various outcomes pre-reform, including in the diﬀerence',\n",

       "   'the global savings glut in the early 2000’s We ﬁnd that the widening of the US trade deﬁcit in the early 2000’s actually pushes inﬂation up, though the magnitude of this effect is modest this effect works through general equilibrium effects of increasing trade deﬁcits on the real natural rate, similar to anticipated increases in trade Second, we introduce variable markups in the model, by assuming that preferences and technologies take the Kimball (1995) form, as in Gopinath et al (2020) This set up allows trade to have pro-competitive effects, whereby increases in foreign sourcing of ﬁnal goods and inputs restrain markups set by domestic producers [Feentra and Weinstein (2017) Jaravel and Sager (2019)] Despite these pro-competitive effects, we ﬁnd again that trade integration increases inﬂation, even more than in the baseline model due to general equilibrium effects on the supply side of the economy by which lower markups raise domestic output At the same time, our simulated data suggests that failure to control for changes in markups induced by trade may help explain the reduced sensitivity of inﬂation to the domestic output gap – i e , the ﬂattening of the empirical Phillips curve – over time Third, we build out the model to include multiple sectors, with heterogeneous sourcing dy3 namics across sectors and end uses In the multisector model, we again ﬁnd trade integration is inﬂationary Further, we show the multisector model yields a decline in the relative price of manufacturing output, as observed in the data Rising trade also appears – in an accounting sense – to restrain inﬂation in the model, as in our initial',\n",

       "   'wage (c rwt) is endogenously linked to ˆλM Ht Equation 33 accounts for changes in the real wage through the output gap Further, by focusing attention on the gap between the actual and ﬂexible price equilibria, this analytical approach nets out changes in domestic sourcing that inﬂuence both the actual and ﬂexible price equilibria symmetrically Combining Equation 33 with the consumer price index, the consumer price Phillips curve is πCt = \\x12(ϵ −1)(1−α)χ φ \\x13 \\x02 ˆyt −ˆyn t \\x03 + βEtπCt+1 + 1 (η −1) \\x02 ∆ˆλC Ht −βEt∆ˆλC Ht+1 \\x03 , (34) where ∆ˆλC Ht ≡ˆλC Ht −ˆλC Ht−1 = ∆lnλC Ht is the log change in domestic sourcing across adjacent periods In contrast to domestic price inﬂation, changes in domestic sourcing for ﬁnal goods directly impact consumer price inﬂation Given expected future changes in domestic ﬁnal goods sourcing (Et∆ˆλC Ht+1) and inﬂation (πCt+1), and the current output gap ( ˆyt −ˆyn t ), a reduction in domestic sourcing today (∆ˆλC Ht<0) lowers consumer price inﬂation This is intuitive, as a reduction in domestic sourcing is associated with a terms of trade improvement, which directly lowers overall consumer price inﬂation In contrast, an anticipated reduction in domestic sourcing tomorrow (Et∆ˆλC Ht+1 < 0) raises consumer price inﬂation today, all else equal 2Given πCt+1, lower domestic sourcing at date t + 1 implies that future domestic price inﬂation (πHt+1) must be higher, which is associated with higher domestic price inﬂation today, via Equation 33 These results emphasize that the dynamics of domestic sourcing are important for understanding inﬂation, and we will return to this point below 23 2 3 2 IS Curve The output gap reﬂects the structure of the Euler equation, as is standard Referring again to Appendix B 3 for detailed derivation, the IS curve can be written as \\x02 ˆyt −ˆyn t \\x03 = −1 θρ \\x02ˆ˜rt −ˆ˜rn t \\x03 +',\n",

       "   'effects to an increase in productivity By lowering future production costs, an expected decline in domestic sourcing of inputs leads to higher future output and income This increase in future income further leads consumers to attempt to pull consumption forward in time, leading the natural rate to rise As we shall see below, both these mechanisms are crucial for interpreting the impact of domestic sourcing dynamics on inﬂation 2 3 3 Aggregate Demand/Supply Interpretation Collecting the results above, we can deﬁne a three equation model that determines the output gap (ˆyt −ˆyn t ), consumer price inﬂation (πCt), and the interest rate (ˆrt) The equilibrium system is given by Equation 34, Equation 35 with the solution for the real natural interest rate (Equation 36) and the deﬁnition of the real interest rate (ˆ˜rt ≡ˆrt −EtπCt+1), and the monetary policy rule ˆrt = ωπCt 24 Combining the monetary policy rule with the IS curve, one can deﬁne a downward sloping “aggregate demand” (AD) schedule in \\x08 πCt, ˆyt −ˆyn t , with πCt on the y-axis and ˆyt −ˆyn t on the xaxis, where higher inﬂation today is associated with lower values of the output gap, since the central bank raises interest rates in response The Phillips curve is then upward sloping, where a higher value of the output gap today raises current inﬂation (all else equal) Echoing standard textbooks, this Phillips curve can be thought of as an “aggregate supply” (AS) relation We emphasize the intuition based on this AD/AS version of the model in describing analytical results below 2 4 Shocks and Inﬂation in the Three Equation Model In this section, we use the three equation representation of the model to interpret the inﬂation results',\n",

       "   'these shocks drive inﬂation up For case (ii), an anticipated decline in domestic sourcing of inputs also shifts the AD schedule up, but it leaves the AS schedule unchanged, because changes in domestic sourcing of inputs only affect inﬂation through the output gap 21 Thus, anticipated declines in domestic input sourcing also raise inﬂation 21The direct effect of ˆλM Ht on real marginal cost (d rmct) is subsumed in the output gap, as the direct effect of input sourcing on marginal costs is the same in the ﬂexible and rigid price equilibria See the discussion above following Equation 33 and corresponding derivations in Appendix B 3 25 The shocks described in Proposition 1 are a stylized depiction of the shocks plotted in Figure 4a, abstracting from medium term dynamics As of the mid-1990’s, it was widely understood that the world was on a path toward increased globalization, and this reality materialized over the ensuing long decade Consistent with the proposition, simulated inﬂation in Figure 4b is persistently above zero as trade increases between 1997 and 2009 This is the basic story of inﬂationary globalization in the model In addition to this broad perspective, inﬂation also responds to the medium term dynamics of the sourcing shares 22 These dynamics are most pronounced for the input sourcing share, where domestic input sourcing falls rapidly in the ﬁrst half of the period and then reverts back toward its initial level, though it remains lower in the long run than it started This initial rapid decline accentuates the rise in overall inﬂation in early years Further, as the shock reverts, the logic inverts the phased rise in domestic input sourcing (“reshoring”) after 2010',\n",
       "   'as the shock reverts, the logic inverts the phased rise in domestic input sourcing (“reshoring”) after 2010 actually drives inﬂation down (below zero) in the model These results testify to the importance of trade dynamics in explaining inﬂation outcomes Staying with this theme, we now discuss the conventional wisdom regarding the impact of rising trade on inﬂation, and how our argument differs from it 2 4 2 Parsing Conventional Wisdom Some changes in domestic sourcing do have deﬂationary impacts We now consider both transitory and permanent declines in domestic sourcing that are unanticipated Proposition 2 Consider (i) an unanticipated, permanent decline in the domestic sourcing share for ﬁnal goods, such that ∆ˆλC Ht < 0, and ∆ˆλC Ht+k = 0 for k ≥1, or (ii) an unanticipated, transitory decline in the domestic sourcing share for ﬁnal goods, such that ∆ˆλC Ht < 0, ∆ˆλC Ht+1 = −∆ˆλC Ht and ∆ˆλC Ht+k = 0 for k ≥2 For shock sequences (i) or (ii), inﬂation is negative at date t πCt < 0 Proof See Appendix C 2 □ This proposition indicates that immediate declines in domestic ﬁnal goods sourcing – whether temporary or permanent – lower inﬂation today Our view is that the conventional wisdom that increasing trade lowers inﬂation is largely based on thinking through the impacts of these types of shocks Both in the permanent and transitory cases, the AS curve – equivalently, the Phillips curve – shifts down on impact, directly lowering inﬂation Moreover, the shift is more pronounced 22There are signiﬁcant short term effects of changes in domestic sourcing surrounding the Great Trade Collapse in 2008-2010 Anticipation of the collapse (though somewhat implausible), accounts for the decline in inﬂation in the mid-2000s More plausibly, anticipated',\n",

It is easy to show that the central bank could mute the inﬂationary effect of trade integration by following a rule that allows for a time-varying natural rate of interest, as in ˆrt = ˆrn t +ωπCt (39) This type of policy rule is sometimes referred to as a “stochastic intercept rule ” In contrast to the prior rules we have discussed, this rule has a forward looking dimension, because the natural rate responds to expected future variables The following proposition describes the impact of anticipated changes in domestic',\n",

       "   '– which does not control for markup shocks The direction of this bias depends on the correlation of ˆϵHt with d rmct In our simulated data, this correlation is negative – markups are low due to import competition when the output gap is positive and real marginal costs are high As a result, failing to control for trade-induced changes in markups would impart downward bias on the slope of the empirical Phillips Curve To quantify this bias, we turn to our simulated data The true theoretical relationship between domestic price inﬂation and real marginal costs is given by Equation 45, where ϵH0−1 φ = 0 084 We then consider the following empirical Phillips Curve regression in our simulated data πHt = ϱ1d rmct + ϱ2Et (πHt+1)+ut, where ut = −1 φ ˆϵHt is treated as a regression residual The resulting OLS estimates are ˆϱ1 = 0 05 and ˆϱ2 = 994 (note ˆϱ2 ≈β) The punchline is that failing to control for markup changes biases the estimated slope of the Phillips Curve downward (toward zero) by about 40% To summarize, trade-induced changes in markups restrain inﬂation relative to what it would have been given changes in real marginal costs (or domestic slack more generally) in our model simulations In turn, estimates of the Phillips curve during this globalization era that do not control for changing markups suffer from an omitted variable bias, which makes inﬂation appear less sensitive to domestic slack than it truly is This bias may help explain why the slope of the empirical Phillips curve has declined in the last couple decades, when pro-competitive effects of trade have plausibly been strongest 4 Multisector Model We now turn to a multisector',\n",

       "   'point that stands out here is that the dynamics of sourcing in the non-manufacturing sector are important in explaining the dip in inﬂation in the post-2010 period, while both shocks drive inﬂation up in the pre-2010 period Another way to emphasize this result is to examine an alternative simulation with unequal elasticities across sectors We consider a scenario in which the elasticity between home and foreign goods is higher for non-manufacturing than manufacturing, with an elasticity of 2 in manufacturing and an elasticity of 6 in non-manufacturing This is a plausible case, since non-manufacturing includes agriculture and natural resources In Figure 9d, we plot the results from this heterogeneous elasticity simulation, along with the equal elasticity simulation (repeated from Figure 9a) Inﬂation is substantially higher during the 2010-2020 period in this simulation The reason is that the larger elasticity for the non-manufacturing sectors shrinks the importance of the u-shaped evolution of domestic sourcing of non-manufacturing inputs by the manufacturing sector, because it reduces the implied change in the relative price of home versus foreign non-manufactured inputs In general, however, allowing heterogeneous elasticities does not change the overall behavior of the inﬂation 4 3 Accounting for Price Changes in the Multisector Model In Section 1, we presented accounting results that suggested rising trade played a large role in explaining price changes over time In contrast, throughout the model simulations, we have emphasized the exact opposite result inﬂation rises due to increasing trade As a ﬁnal exercise, we bring these results together, by demonstrating that the basic accounting results hold in this multisector model In this multisector model, sector-level inﬂation for domestic goods can be written as πHt =',\n",

       "   'trade on markups overturn these basic forces, and they may in fact strengthen them Overall, we are left with the conclusion that trade integration is inﬂationary To conclude, we highlight three topics that merit further work First, while we have developed our argument for a small open economy, it would be natural to revisit the questions we ask in large open economy models While we believe our conclusions are robust to this extension, multicountry models would provide fertile ground to study how changes in trade inﬂuence inﬂation synchronization across countries Second, our framework adopts a sufﬁcient statistics approach to analyze historical developments in trade To study prospective shocks – whether to trade policy or other exogenous variables – one needs to solve for the impact of those policies on domestic sourcing shares themselves This requires taking a stand on features of the model that inﬂuence trade dynamics in response to those shocks (e g , the currency invoicing of trade) This is a fertile area for work as well Lastly, we have adopted a rule-based approach to characterizing monetary policy While this is consistent with how many central banks (most importantly, the Federal Reserve) have behaved over this period, additional analysis of monetary policy would be worthwhile For one, we have not attempted to characterize optimal policy in response to trade shocks, which may have both transitory and permanent components An analysis of how optimal policy differs with varying assumptions regarding the response of markups and the multisector structure of the economy could lead to important policy insights Farther aﬁeld, the central bank’s desired level of inﬂation may be endogenous, as in Romer (1993) and',\n",

       "   'observed import price index (IPI), as measured by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) international price program, so then BFt(s) represents sources of bias that lead measured price indexes to deviate from the (production-cost relevant) measure of import prices required by the model 37 There are two key sources for this bias 38 The ﬁrst is that existing import price deﬂators do not capture the full impact of offshoring on the cost of inputs In a multi-country environment, producers have the ability to substitute among foreign input suppliers (e g , from Japanese to Chinese suppliers) These cost-saving substitutions are not captured in the multilateral import price indexes produced by the BLS, which implies that measured import prices are likely to biased upward relative to reality, akin to outlet substitution bias in consumer price measurement [Reinsdorf and Yuskavage (2018)] More broadly, producers also beneﬁt from substituting cheaper foreign for domestic inputs Because this substitution is not accounted for in measurement of either import prices or domestic purchaser prices by the BLS, it is difﬁcult to estimate the change in the unit cost of the ﬁrm’s input bundle from existing data This can be interpreted as a second source of bias in the relative price of imports in our model, which leads the ratio of measured import prices to domestic output prices to understate the decline in costs associated with offshoring 39 A second source of bias is that non-price factors may drive substitution between domestic and foreign inputs A leading concern is that unmeasured improvements in foreign product quality or variety have driven ﬁrms to source inputs from abroad In our application, quality bias is a 37Throughout the discussion that',\n",
       "   'ﬁrms to source inputs from abroad In our application, quality bias is a 37Throughout the discussion that follows, we assume that data sources record the quality-adjusted price of domestic output accurately This assumption is a reasonable way to proceed for two reasons First, in practice, the BLS performs more extensive quality adjustment in the Producer Price Index (PPI) price program than it does under its Import Price Index program For example, hedonic price adjustment occurs for producer prices, but not for import prices Second, rapid changes in the international economy and trading environment point to problems of price measurement as likely being most severe for imports [Houseman and Mandel (2015) Moulton (2018)] 38In addition to speciﬁc papers cited below, see also Houseman and Mandel (2015) and Moulton (2018) 39Put differently, using PPI and IPI data to construct changes in input costs would overstate cost growth of the composite input Since this bias would lead to the understatement of the quantity of inputs used in production, it also would tend to overstate productivity growth [Houseman et al (2011)] 52 particularly important concern – the BLS is not able to account for quality improvements in imports using the same methods applied to domestic producer prices For example, while the BLS applies hedonic adjustments in producer price data, it does not do so for import prices A ﬁnal, somewhat different, challenge in using price data is that ﬁrms/industries are linked to one another Even if import prices were measured perfectly, producers may experience cost reductions either because they directly substitute foreign for domestic ones, or because they buy inputs from upstream suppliers who themselves engage in',\n",
       "   'substitute foreign for domestic ones, or because they buy inputs from upstream suppliers who themselves engage in offshoring Thus, one also needs input use data to track the propagation of offshoring-induced reductions in costs through the network structure of the economy This industry-level input use data, collected by the BEA, is not directly comparable with BLS-measured prices in terms of coverage and measurement conventions Thus, it is challenging to combine import and domestic price data with input-output data, or to aggregate the results to examine the ultimate effect of imported input prices on consumer or investment goods price levels Our approach to circumventing these problems combines data on changes in imported input expenditure shares with a structural model to impute changes in unit costs attributable to offshoring While enhanced efforts to improve price collection and measurement are needed, the distinct advantage of our approach is that we are able to use “off the self” data from the national accounts to address the macroeconomic impact of offshoring B Baseline Model B 1 Model Equilibrium Conditions The equilibrium conditions for the baseline model in Section 2 are collected in Table 2 B 2 Calibration Details Parameter values for model simulations are recorded in Table 3 In this parameterization, we set the elasticity of substitution among domestic varieties (ϵ) equal to the elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods (η) Put differently, we set the macro-Armington elasticity between home and foreign goods equal to the microeconomic elasticity between domestic varieties This is consistent with estimates in Feenstra et al (2018), which fails to reject equality of these elasticities for most goods This parameterization also facilitates comparison of this baseline model to the model',\n",

       "   'in Table 5 To reduce and simplify this system, we make the following observations First, we calibrate the model so that preference parameters ν and ζ match the domestic shares of ﬁnal and input expenditure With an appropriate choice of units, we have PH0/PC0 = τC0PF0/PC0 = 1 and PH0/PM0 = τM0PF0/PM0 = 1, so CH0 = νC0, CF0 = (1 −ν)C0, MH0 = ζM0, and MF0 = (1−ζ)M0 Second, with this result in hand, it is possible to show that ˆdCt = 0 and ˆdMt = 0 in any equilibrium Working ﬁrst with consumption, the ﬁnal goods aggregator implies that aggregate consumption satisﬁes ˆct = CH0 C0 ˆcHt + CF0 C0 ˆcFt Given the nominal spending identity PCtCt = PHtCHt + τCtPFtCFt, then the price index can be expressed as ˆpCt = CH0 C0 ˆpHt + CF0 C0 ( ˆτCt + ˆpFt), where PH0 PC0 = 1 and τC0PF0 PC0 = 1 Then, plugging the ﬁrst order conditions into the consumption aggregator and simplifying yields 0 = CH0 C0 h\\x10 ˆdCt + ˆpHt −ˆpCt \\x11i + CF0 C0 h\\x10 ˆdCt + ˆτCt + ˆpFt −ˆpCt \\x11i = ˆdCt, where the second equality uses the prior result for ˆpCt An identical procedure applied to inputs then returns ˆdMt = 0 as well Third, we can draw on the arguments in the text and these ﬁrst two results to write relative prices as functions of changes in domestic sourcing shares ˆpHt −ˆpCt = − 1 σ −1 ˆλC Ht (173) ˆτCt + ˆpFt −ˆpCt = − 1 σ −1 ˆλC Ft = − 1 σ −1 λF0 λH0 ˆλC Ht (174) ˆpHt −ˆpMt = − 1 σ −1 ˆλM Ht (175) ˆτMt + ˆpFt −ˆpMt = − 1 σ −1 ˆλM Ft = − 1 σ −1 λF0 λH0 ˆλM Ht, (176) where we have used λC Ht +λC Ft = 1 and λM Ht +λM Ft = 1 82 Fourth, given this rewriting, we can solve a subset',\n",

The ratio of the standard deviation of aggregate markup to that of aggregate output is 59% in the data and 36% in our calibrated model (median across samples) Although our model with ﬁrm-level shocks generates non-negligible ﬂuctuations in aggregate output and markups, it only accounts for a fraction of aggregate ﬂuctuations in the data Moreover, as we discussed above, the correlation of markups and output is much higher than that in the data In what follows, we show that if we superimpose on our calibrated model aggregate productivity shocks – in order to match aggregate output volatility in the data – the procyclicality of markups is much lower and closer to the data As discussed in the',\n",

       "   'of these market-share volatilities, aggregate volatility is slightly higher under variable markups In all cases, variable markups have a limited impact on reducing aggregate output volatility 58Whereas variable markups reduce the volatility of aggregate output, markup heterogeneity per se contributes to higher aggregate volatility By equation (30), markup heterogeneity under constant markups does not affect output changes with linear disutility of labor (f →∞) However, with ﬁnite labor disutility,reallocation of economic activity across heterogeneous markup ﬁrms is an additional source of output ﬂuctuations, as studied in Baqaee and Farhi (2019) In our model, the median standard deviation under heterogeneous and constant markups is 1 18 times that under homogeneous and constant markups (the 95% conﬁdence interval is 1 13-1 22) Combining both results, the standard deviation under variable and heterogeneous markups is 1 02 times that under homogeneous and constant markups (the 95% conﬁdence interval is 0 99-1 14) That is, output volatility under variable markups is only slightly higher than under constant and homogeneous markups 46 One obvious route for future work is to superimpose in our model alternative shocks and frictions Along this line, prime candidates would be to consider price setting and customeraccumulation frictions (see, e g , Gilchrist et al 2017 and Afrouzi 2019), as well as aggregate monetary and ﬁnancial shocks Relatedly, we have focused on static, intra-temporal markup decisions in which movements in markups are the result of changes in the shape of the demand curve in response to ﬁrm-level shocks These forces would remain relevant even if one were to extend the model to allow for richer inter-temporal dynamics that result in more complex dynamic markup strategies (see e g , Rotemberg and',\n",

       "   'providers bear a negative exposure to market volatility Since market volatility carries a large negative price of risk in option markets (Carr and Wu, 2008), the negative exposure of liquidity providers explains why liquidity provision earns a substantial premium (Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2015), why this premium increases with volatility (Nagel, 2012), and why liquidity contracts during crises (Brunnermeier, 2009) By integrating liquidity and volatility, our results provide a new perspective on the risks and returns to liquidity provision Why do liquidity providers have a negative exposure to market volatility? The basic problem liquidity providers face is adverse selection by investors with private information In standard models (e g Kyle, 1985), the quantity of private information in the market is constant and known to liquidity providers It therefore poses no risk to them While this is a simple assumption, it is clearly unrealistic Volatility, the observed end-product of the ﬂow of information, is highly time-varying, both at the level of individual assets and for the market as a whole Moreover, the volatilities of individual assets covary strongly with each other and with market volatility This suggests that ﬂows of information, both public and private, vary substantially over time and in a synchronous manner To capture this co-movement, we extend the model of Kyle (1985) by making the amounts of market and private information uncertain and positively correlated Because of this correlation, market volatility informs liquidity providers about the amount of private information they face In particular, an increase in market volatility leads them to estimate a greater amount of private information As in Kyle (1985), liquidity providers’ estimate of private information determines how much they',\n",
       "   'amount of private information As in Kyle (1985), liquidity providers’ estimate of private information determines how much they adjust prices in the direction of the net order ﬂow they receive If their estimate is too low, they adjust prices too little, and because of adverse selection trade too much with informed investors They then accumulate long positions at prices that are too high and short positions at prices that are too low Now consider what happens when there is a positive shock to market volatility The shock increases liquidity providers’ estimate of private information Liquidity providers learn that they had not adjusted prices enough and likely traded too much with informed investors Prices immediately come to reﬂect this Liquidity providers see their long 1 positions fall and their short positions rise, taking losses across the portfolio The opposite happens when a negative shock hits liquidity providers’ estimate of private information declines, their longs rise and their shorts fall In sum, liquidity providers have a negative exposure to market volatility In existing models of liquidity provision, which focus on inventory risk (e g , Stoll, 1978 Grossman and Miller, 1988), a liquidity provider’s risk is idiosyncratic To explain the liquidity premium these models assume that some friction prevents the liquidity provider from diversifying this risk away While this may apply in some cases, particularly for small and thinly-traded assets, it is unlikely to explain the liquidity premium among large and heavily-traded assets In our model liquidity providers face a systematic risk (ﬂuctuations in market volatility) that cannot be diversiﬁed away We thus need to specify how this risk is priced by the economy’s stochastic discount factor Consistent with the',\n",
       "   'need to specify how this risk is priced by the economy’s stochastic discount factor Consistent with the strong evidence from option prices, we assume that market volatility carries a large negative price of risk This implies that liquidity providers earn a positive premium for the negative volatility risk exposure they bear The premiums for liquidity and volatility are thus one and the same To test the model, we need to proxy for liquidity providers’ portfolios, which are not directly observed As in Nagel (2012), the model shows that they are mimicked by shortterm reversals (e g , Lehmann, 1990), a trading strategy that buys assets whose price has fallen and shorts assets whose price has risen The reason for this is that a large price change reﬂects a large net order ﬂow, requiring the liquidity provider to take a large position We thus use reversals to proxy for the returns to liquidity provision We build reversal portfolios using daily U S stock returns from 2001 to 2020 (i e , the period since “decimalization,” when liquidity provision became competitive see Bessembinder, 2003) Each day we sort stocks into quintiles by market cap and deciles by the day’s return, normalized by its rolling standard deviation as implied by our model Also as implied by our model, we weight the portfolios by dollar volume to proxy for the size of liquidity providers’ holdings This gives us ﬁfty portfolios sorted by size and return We further construct long-short reversal strategies within each size quintile by buying the low-return deciles and shorting the high-return deciles Lo–Hi, 2–9, 3–8, 4–7, and 5–6 The outermost-decile strategies carry the strongest reversal signal and therefore capture',\n",

       "   'we test the model’s central prediction that reversal strategies’ volatility risk (their VIX betas) can explain their average returns We again estimate volatility betas by regressing each strategy’s return on the contemporaneous change in VIX-squared (we also control for the market return to remove any market beta) We ﬁnd that the volatility betas are strongly negative they are largest for the Lo–Hi strategies (−0 2 in the case of large-caps) and converge toward zero for the 5–6 strategies Thus, consistent with the model, the reversal strategies’ volatility betas display the same pattern as their average returns This is the cross-sectional analog of the time-series result in Figure 1 We use Fama-MacBeth regressions to formally test whether volatility risk explains the reversal strategies’ average returns The estimated premium for the volatility betas is a large and signiﬁcant −1 08% per unit of beta per ﬁve days This number is consistent with the highly negative variance risk premium found in the prices of index options The VIXsquared betas shrink the pricing errors of the portfolios dramatically The pricing error of the large-cap Lo–Hi strategy drops from 17 bps to −2 bps and becomes statistically insigniﬁcant Similarly, the second-largest quintile’s Lo–Hi pricing error shrinks from 13 bps to −1 bps Only the very smallest stocks’ Lo–Hi pricing error remains large and signiﬁcant These stocks, which account for less than 0 2% of total market value, appear to behave quite differently than the rest Besides this exception, the reversal strategies’ average returns are explained well by their volatility betas In particular, the pricing error of an overall liquidity provider portfolio, which we construct by combining the reversal strategies as implied by the',\n",
       "   'an overall liquidity provider portfolio, which we construct by combining the reversal strategies as implied by the model, drops from 17 bps to 0 8 bps Volatility risk thus explains the overall liquidity premium in the cross section of stocks Since market variance is traded directly in the index options market, we can use index option returns to estimate its price of risk and test if it explains the reversal returns Following the literature, we do so by using the VIX squared, which equals the price of a basket of options that replicates an S P 500 variance swap From the returns on this basket, we estimate that the price per unit of VIX-squared beta in option markets is −1 03%, which is very close to our estimate from the equity reversal strategies 4 We set the price of VIX-squared risk to this restricted value (and the premium for market risk to the market’s average excess return) and calculate the reversal strategies’ pricing errors 2 The restricted pricing tests perform very similarly to the unrestricted Fama-MacBeth regressions, reﬂecting the similar price of risk estimates For instance, the pricing errors of the largest and second-largest quintiles’ Lo–Hi portfolios decrease from 0 17 bps and 13 bps to −1 bps As before, only the pricing error of the smallest stocks’ Lo–Hi portfolio remains large and signiﬁcant The pricing error of the overall liquidity portfolio drops from 17 bps to 1 5 bps Thus, small-stock reversals stand out from the others While their VIX betas are negative, they are too small to explain their outsized returns This suggests that undiversiﬁed inventory risk may play a role To analyze this, we extend',\n",

       "   \"that can be quantified through empirical or CGE models Both Hafstead and Williams (2018) and Aubert and Chiroleu-Assouline (2019) introduce pollution policy and unemployment resulting from labor search frictions into an analytical general equilibrium model Our paper follows this third approach The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of pollution taxes on unemployment and incidence using an analytical general equilibrium model where unemployment is endogenously generated via efficiency wages Workers' effort is a function of the real wage and the economy's unemployment level Pollution is modeled as a production input along with capital and labor  3 We find closed-form analytic solutions for the general equilibrium responses to a change in the pollution tax rate, including expressions for changes in the unemployment rate, factor prices (the sources-side incidence), output prices (the uses-side incidence), and worker effort The model allows us to decompose the net effects into substitution effects, output effects, and effects from the efficiency wage specification Lastly, we conduct numerical simulations using calibrated parameter values Our modeling approach dates back to the canonical tax incidence modeling of Harberger (1962) Like Agell and Lundborg (1992) and Rapanos (2006), our paper adds an efficiency wage theory of unemployment to the model, though those papers do not model pollution Like Fullerton and Heutel (2007), our paper adds pollution and pollution taxes to the model, though that paper does not model unemployment 1 We incorporate both efficiency wages and environmental policy into a Harberger-style analytical general\",\n",

       "   'Conserving biodiversity, the range of species on the planet, is crucial to human survival and prosperity We are a part of biodiversity, and if biodiversity is destroyed, we may be a part of what is lost Biodiversity is crucial to human well-being we evolved in concert with it and are dependent on it in myriad ways, some obvious and some subtle  A powerful illustration of the importance of biodiversity comes from a review of the habitability of Earth compared with our immediate neighbors in the solar system, Venus and Mars Neither is remotely habitable Venus way too hot, Mars too cold, Venus with a poisonous atmosphere and Mars with none Why does Earth have a temperature which is just right for animals like us, and an atmosphere that allows us to live? Because, unlike Venus and Mars, Earth is surrounded by the biosphere, the thin layer of atmosphere, oceans and plant and animal life that extends from the surface of Earth to about ten thousand meters above it The gaseous composition of the atmosphere ensures that Earth is at a temperature at which we can thrive, and also provides the oxygen we need to function This atmospheric composition arose as a result of the evolution of blue-green algae, and then much later plants, which by photosynthesis removed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and replaced it by oxygen, thereby both making our lives possible and stabilizing earth’s temperature Without the natural world that surrounds us we would not and indeed could not exist it',\n",
       "   'Without the natural world that surrounds us we would not and indeed could not exist it brought us into existence Biodiversity is a key element of this natural world  The importance of the natural world, the biosphere, is also emphasized by the extraordinary story of Biosphere 2 Looking like a collection of alien spaceships amidst the sand and cacti of the Sonoran Desert in Arizona, Biosphere 2 is a set of sealed glass buildings enclosing a 3 15-acre ecosystem Built at great expense and with the latest technologies, its two-year mission was to investigate the possibility of supporting human life in a totally self-contained system Eight “biospherians” inhabited this complex, together with pollinating insects, and were to grow all their own food in a system with a fixed volume of air and water, both of which were to be recycled and reused Biosphere 2 was to replicate the functioning of the original biosphere in miniature  Simply put, it failed after eighteen months the oxygen level fell from 21 percent to 14 percent, a level normal at 17,500 feet and barely sufficient for humans to function All of the insect pollinators died, meaning that people had to transfer pollen with Q-tips from flower to flower in the hope of eventually 1 Gmh1 gsb columbia edu This paper was written for inclusion in the report Financing Nature Closing the Global Biodiversity Financing Gap, published by the Paulson Institute, The Nature Conservancy and the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability  2 getting a zucchini Had they continued in',\n",
       "   'and the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability  2 getting a zucchini Had they continued in Biosphere 2, the humans would not have been able to breath or eat The bottom line is that, sophisticated though we may be, we can’t replicate what the natural world provides for us, and so can’t survive without it  Economic Framework Economists recognize the importance of the natural world to the functioning of our societies, and think of this in terms of capital stocks A capital stock is an asset that provides a flow of services over time An investment in equities provides a flow of dividends an investment in a house provides a flow of accommodation services an investment in a computer provides a flow of digital services These are examples of the most commonly-recognized types of capital, financial capital (equities) and built capital (houses, computers) Other categories of assets also provide a flow of services over time knowledge is one of the most important If you train as a lawyer or accountant or a computer programmer, you can use the knowledge acquired to generate a flow of income over time We call this human capital, capital embedded in human beings  For present purposes, another category, natural capital, is important Natural capital refers to lands, waters and the diversity of life that provide human societies with a flow of services over time Norway has great lakes that provide huge amounts of electricity via hydro-electric power stations these lakes and the hydrological systems that replenish',\n",

       "   'COVID-19 and both bank deposits and deposit interest rates Given welldocumented differences in COVID-19 infection rates across U S counties and assuming that these differences translate into cross-county differences in concerns about future income, the precautionary savings view suggests a positive relation between COVID-19 cases and bank deposits at the county level Furthermore, the COVID-19 driven increase in local deposits will reduce local deposit interest rates, as long as there is some segmentation of banking markets Although past research provides mixed evidence on the importance of precautionary savings (e g , Dynan 1993 Starr-McCluer 1996 Carroll and Samwick 1998 Engen and Gruber 2001, Agarwal and Qian 2014 D’Acunto et al 2020), we make an initial effort to evaluate the precautionary savings view in the context of a pandemic such as the COVID-19 using granular and high frequency data Second, the “flight-to-safety” view stresses that adverse financial market shocks induce people to flee from risky investments and into the safety of bank deposits (e g , Bernanke Gertler, and Gilchrist 1996 Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein 2002 Gatev and Strahan 2 2006 Cornett et al 2011), while stock market booms are associated with a reduction in households’ demand for deposits (Lin 2019) When applied to the COVID-19 pandemic, this flight-to-safety view suggests that COVID-19 triggered financial market panic that prompted investors to allocate more of their savings to deposits The COVID-19 crisis, however, is qualitatively different from the crises underlying past flight-to-safety studies, because the COVID-19 crisis did not originate as a shock to the financial sector Thus, past research on',\n",

       "   'expansionary monetary and fiscal policies could have triggered the flow into deposits (e g Agarwal et al , 2020) From this perspective, the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases and lending programs and the Federal government’s spending programs may have induced deposits to swell The massive increase in deposits, therefore, might have more to do with national policies than with actions driven by a flight-to-safety, precautionary savings, or banks’ demand-for-deposits  3 In this paper, we primarily use weekly branch-level data on deposit interest rates and county-level data on COVID-19 cases to evaluate why deposits surged during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic For each bank branch, we use weekly data on interest rates on CDs (certificates of deposit) For each county, we use the logarithm of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per one million people on the Friday of each week Our primary sample includes 287,262 branch-week observations over the period from January through April of 2019 and 2020, involving 9,847 branches We examine deposit interest rates to help distinguish between views stressing supply- or demand-side shocks The flight-to-safety, precautionary savings, and expansionary policy views stress that COVID-19 triggered a surge in the supply of deposits, implying a drop in deposit interest rates In contrast, the demand-for-deposits view predicts that rates will rise as banks seek to attract funds to satisfy borrowers drawing down their credit lines By examining deposit rates, we provide evidence on which effect dominates In our baseline analyses, we regress deposit interest rates at the branch-county-week level on the county’s',\n",

       "   'begun to mandate employer−provided PSL As of October 2023, 14 states plus the District of Columbia (referred to as a ‘state’ below) have adopted or announced a PSL mandate (National Partnership for Women Families, 2023) These mandates require employers to provide, on average, seven days of PSL per year (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2021), granting access to PSL benefits to 21 million employees (National Partnership for Women Families, 2023),1 and increasing generosity of the benefit for many other employees Previous economic studies show that these mandates increase PSL access and use, increase healthcare received, and improve health (e g , by reducing infectious disease), but do not lead employers to curtail wages or other valuable benefits (see Section 2 2) In contrast to concerns sometimes raised by critiques of requiring PSL benefits (Copland, 2013), these mandates are also not overly costly to employers 1Assuming each employee has two dependents, these PSL mandates would result in over 60 million persons (employees and dependents) living in households covered through PSL for the first time 2 We extend the literature examining U S PSL mandates by investigating their impact on birth rates Understanding these effects is important because, while birth rates have been declining for decades (Buckles et al , 2022 Kearney et al , 2022), 40% of pregnancies occur earlier than intended or when no pregnancy is desired (Kost and Lindberg, 2015) Such pregnancies most commonly reflect a failure to use effective contraception (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023b) On the other hand, 19% of married women 15−49 years old experience infertility each year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023a)2 and nearly 13% of reproductive age women receive',\n",

       "   'the birth to term People may take time off just before the birth, which may enhance the propensity for the mother to carry the birth to term, thereby increasing the birth rate PSL could also influence fertility rates through employment outcomes If workers ‘pay’ for PSL through reduced wages, the income effect might reduce fertility, assuming that children are normal goods This effect may be exacerbated if the wage reductions are concentrated among women (because employers view them as more likely to use PSL) and they respond by increasing work hours, which would raise the time costs of fertility Conversely, wages might increase in the longer−run if PSL facilitates employment continuity and, unless offset by substantially longer work hours, the income effect might then be expected to increase fertility In either case, the employment effects would need to be substantial to explain a significant portion of changes in fertility 6 In this study, we combine difference−in−differences and event−study methods with survey and administrative data from 2007 to 2019, a period where PSL mandates were implemented in multiple states We obtain four principal findings First, PSL mandates raise access to and use of PSL in a national survey of establishments Second, the use of contraception among women of child−bearing age and interest in fertility treatments appear to increase post−mandate, with no evidence of changes in abortion rates Third, we find suggestive evidence that employment and wages increase modestly among women of child−bearing age following adoption of a state PSL mandate Fourth, birth rates decline post−PSL mandate, with some heterogeneity in effect size across mothers with different demographic characteristics Thus, while the impact of PSL on birth rates is ex',\n",
       "   'size across mothers with different demographic characteristics Thus, while the impact of PSL on birth rates is ex ante ambiguous as described above, the net effect of PSL in our sample is negative 6Numerous studies demonstrate that the changes to the price (financial or hassle) of family planning services influence fertility outcomes, thus offering empirical premise for our work For example, increasing insurance coverage for contraception (Kearney and Levine, 2009 Carlin et al , 2016) and providing free or reduced cost family planning services (Lindo and Packham, 2017) encourages women to use contraception, reduces fertility rates, and enhances the use of prenatal care (Daw and Sommers, 2018) Conversely, restricting access by closing family planning clinics can have the opposite effect on these outcomes (Packham, 2017) See Bailey and Lindo (2017) for an excellent review of this literature 4 Overall, our findings suggest that mandated PSL benefits facilitate the reproductive choices of women, with the overall effect of reducing birth rates These results are robust to numerous sensitivity checks, including the use of methods that account for potential bias in estimates of the average treatment effect with a staggered policy roll−out 2 Background and prior research 2 1 Paid sick leave in the United States The only permanent federal leave policy in the U S , the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993, provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in a 12−month period for prenatal care and incapacity related to pregnancy, for the birth of a child and to care for the newborn, and for own serious health condition following the birth of a child (U S Department of Labor, ND) Benefits can also be used',\n",

       "   'rough estimate of the potential impact of such a federal policy on the the national birth rate In 2021, there were 3,664,292 registered births in the U S (Martin et al , 2022), 2,468,155 occurring in states without a PSL mandate Assuming the federal mandate was similar in generosity to the state mandates we examine, our preferred model predicts a 2 2% reduction in these births, corresponding to a decline of around 54 thousand births nationally (2,468,155 × −0 022 = 54,299) 58 Our study is subject to caveats First, the extent to which the results obtained using early adopting PSL states would generalize to other states that (may) adopt PSL in the future is unclear Second, our data are somewhat limited along key dimensions our proxy for fertility treatment (internet searches for IVF) is not ideal the abortion data are incomplete and the information contraception is available for only some states and years Third, we do not rigorously examine downstream effects on children nor study other effects of PSL mandates Not withstanding these limitations, previous research indicates that PSL mandates increase the ability of employees to take leaves when needed, raise access to valuable medical care while decreasing the use of unnecessary emergency care, and improve health outcomes Our findings add to this growing literature by showing that these policies may also help in facilitating the reproductive choices of American women and families Understanding how policies influence pregnancy outcomes has become even more salient given recent policy changes in the U S that limit women’s access to family planning services 59 There are potential broader questions about the effects of any resulting decline 58We likely modestly overstate the effects as we do not account',\n",

       "   'browsing that we identify suggest that women could have suffered a relative drop in wellbeing, this conclusion is uncertain because the welfare effects of spending more time online are ambiguous, even during a lockdown (Allcott et al 2020b) We therefore examine gender differences in online job search as an activity linked to more favorable economic outcomes We saw stark disparity in the lockdown’s effects on online job search Men’s time increased by about as much as women’s decreased, resulting in a 40 percent relative drop for women, both overall and in a sample of likely job seekers To address the small number of active job seekers in our sample, we also confirmed the finding of a relative decrease in women’s online job search intensity using a different dataset from a widely used Indian job search platform, with tens of millions of active users Perhaps more than our other gender gaps in browser use, this finding of a relative drop in women’s job search indicates potentially significant economic effects The finding suggests an increase in labor market barriers for women that is especially troubling in the Indian context, where female labor force participation is already depressed and women struggle with job search (Fletcher et al 2017) This study contributes to several strands of the Information Systems (IS) literature First, by showing the impacts of the first Indian lockdown on a wide range of internet browser use outcomes, we contribute to the literature on IT adoption and use by consumers Outside of the pandemic, researchers have examined outcomes',\n",
