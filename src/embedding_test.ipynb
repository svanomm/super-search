Interfamily welfare comparisons are often based on total expenditures per household in a given time period, such as a year To these market expenditures are then added home production, such as food that is produced and consumed in the home, and the imputed value of the consumer services that the household derives from its physical assets, predominantly in the form of owner-occupied housing and consumer durables This measure of total market-purchased and home-produced consumption is a widely used approximation for “permanent income,” or the present discounted value of average lifetime income opportunities, which is expected to influence the welfare of household members in the long run In contrast, “current income” is heavily affected by temporary fluctuations in income that households are expected to try to smooth over time into their current flow of consumption, by adding to or drawing down lifecycle savings (debt) Lifetime expected income is therefore the family resource variable that should be related to lifetime fertility, and this lifetime income constraint is approximated by examining total household consumption This consumption is then divided by the number of adults in the household who share the consumption, to arrive at a measure of average consumption opportunities or, from the perspective of production, average adult productivity 3 Because one objective of this essay is to examine the relationship between economic income and fertility, it is inappropriate to measure income as the household’s per capita consumption, allowing explicitly for the “needs” of children in the household The convention of measuring parents’ consumption opportunities in per capita terms explicitly introduces parents’ reproductive choices inversely into the measure of parents’ consumption opportunities If my goal is to estimate the causal relationship between parents’ economic opportunities and their fertility, dividing consumption opportunities by the number of',\n",

       "  'respectively 13 The purpose of distinguishing between the random event of a birth of twins and other sources of behaviorally influenced fertility variation is to show that the supply and demand components of fertility are related differently to one widely used measure of child welfare, W/H The estimated overall association of fertility to W/H is negative, but a small fraction of that associated with the random supply shock of twins Evidently, the distinction between the behavioral demand and random genetic supply variation in fertility is critical If we want to assess the impact of how a population policy is likely to affect the health and nutritional welfare of a woman’s children, or her household’s consumption, it is important to understand the source of the change in fertility A national family-planning program that reduced the effective cost of birth control sufficiently to reduce the average number of births among Kenyan women by 1 would, according to these estimates, raise the W/H of the next generation of Kenyan children by 1 to 2 standard deviation, and increase overall consumption opportunities per adult in the average Kenyan household CONCLUSIONS Forecasting the consequences of economic development on Kenyan fertility is complicated First, one must know the sources of that economic growth If growth is achieved by increasing the income returns from land, for example, it is likely that Kenyan fertility will remain high, perhaps because parents view land and the labor of children as complementary factors in their meager production If economic growth is stimulated by extending additional education to women, the resulting relative rise in the price of children will favor a continuing decline in fertility, as observed in many studies within a low-income country and estimated across countries and over time (P Schultz 1994, 1997) Most parents benefit from an improvement in birth control that allows them to avoid unwanted births at less cost Analogously, a policy that could miraculously reduce the incidence of twins not only would reduce fertility but also might raise family income, as measured in Kenya by consumption per adult, and improve child nutrition and health status, as measured by W/H, which in turn should enhance the child’s productivity as an adult However, a policy that reduces the level of fertility by constraining parents’ demands for children, such as by implementing quantitative restrictions and tax penalties for out-of-plan births, as in China, may not advance family welfare, and could diminish it Fertility and income are caused by many factors To account for the impact of fertility on society, it is useful to distinguish between genetically determined variation in the supply of births that is more or less random, and behavioral variation in the demand for births that is coordinated with many other choices parents make over their lifetimes In the case of economic development and the growth in income, social scientists should distinguish among the various sources of modern economic growth that do not appear to have the same effects on fertility In particular, income that flows from the human capital of the mother and father, and income that flows',\n",
