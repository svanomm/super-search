Interfamily welfare comparisons are often based on total expenditures per household in a given time period, such as a year To these market expenditures are then added home production, such as food that is produced and consumed in the home, and the imputed value of the consumer services that the household derives from its physical assets, predominantly in the form of owner-occupied housing and consumer durables This measure of total market-purchased and home-produced consumption is a widely used approximation for “permanent income,” or the present discounted value of average lifetime income opportunities, which is expected to influence the welfare of household members in the long run In contrast, “current income” is heavily affected by temporary fluctuations in income that households are expected to try to smooth over time into their current flow of consumption, by adding to or drawing down lifecycle savings (debt) Lifetime expected income is therefore the family resource variable that should be related to lifetime fertility, and this lifetime income constraint is approximated by examining total household consumption This consumption is then divided by the number of adults in the household who share the consumption, to arrive at a measure of average consumption opportunities or, from the perspective of production, average adult productivity 3 Because one objective of this essay is to examine the relationship between economic income and fertility, it is inappropriate to measure income as the household’s per capita consumption, allowing explicitly for the “needs” of children in the household The convention of measuring parents’ consumption opportunities in per capita terms explicitly introduces parents’ reproductive choices inversely into the measure of parents’ consumption opportunities If my goal is to estimate the causal relationship between parents’ economic opportunities and their fertility, dividing consumption opportunities by the number of',\n",

       "  'evidence on the effect of child labor on fertility is provided by Cigno and Rosati (2001), who analyze data gathered in 1994 by the Human Development of India Survey The data cover around 35,000 rural households in over 1,700 villages drawn from 16 Indian states Apart from income and other economic variables pertaining to adults, the data contain information on children’s work/study status and their health, nutritional, and education status Cigno and Rosati use the average survival rate at the village level as a measure of the probability of children surviving to age six They set up two possible theoretical scenarios in which parents choose the fertility, the expenditures that impinge on child mortality, and the work/study decisions of their children In one scenario, the parents are altruistic, in that they give full weight to their children’s well-being in the other (nonaltruistic) one, they are concerned only with their own well-being Cigno and Rosati found that, holding income constant, an increase in the number of school-age children increases the probability that the children will work The probability of an additional birth was also seen to increase with the probability that a child will work when older Furthermore, they found that when the village-level survival rate increases, so does the probability that children will be engaged in full-time study—which is consistent with the scenario positing nonaltruistic parents (but not with that of altruistic ones) This finding is also consistent with the arguments made above on the beneficial effect of reduced child mortality on education THE IMPORTANCE OF FEMALE AUTONOMY The role of female autonomy in decision making is increasingly being acknowledged as an important factor impinging on fertility Dyson and Moore (1983), were the first to discuss this factor in relation to the demographics of Indian states There is considerable difference in the demographics of the northern and southern states of India The northern states, characterized by low female autonomy due to kinship arrangements that minimize support to married women, display high fertility and high child mortality rates Women in these states typically marry relative strangers from other villages and after marriage retain almost no ties with their natal families In the southern states, women have considerable autonomy marriages tend to occur within the village to grooms who are not relative strangers, and women maintain considerable contact with their natal families after marriage Female autonomy is important because it determines the relative bargaining power of women in the household Even in developed countries, the relative bargaining power within couples is skewed in favor of males in developing countries, the disparity is far greater This asymmetry has many causes Males are more likely to work in the labor force, and even if the wife earns, the husband’s income is likely to be higher Ownership of property—in particular, land—is vested in the male Therefore, any credit that may be available to the household is accessible only to the male Adding to this is the considerable weight of religious, cultural, and social norms that put women in a weak bargaining position relative to men As remarked',\n",

       "  'aftermath of World War II, age-specific mortality rates declined, and population growth consequently increased in most low-income countries Some observers expected economic pressures to reduce fertility in these low-income countries because of the rising costs of children in urban settings, and the individualistic desires of parents to promote the health and education of their children (Notestein 1945) The more common reaction to this “population explosion” followed the reasoning of Malthus ([1789] 1993), who expected fertility to remain at relatively high levels and rapid population growth to stifle improvements in the standard of living The continuing decline in infant and child mortality in the 1960s caused the proportion of children in these low-income populations to increase This rise in the dependency ratio (the ratio of the young and old to those in the prime working ages of fifteen to sixty-five) was expected to depress the rate of private and public savings, curb investment in physical capital, and thereby slow economic development, unless new policies were able to bribe or coerce parents to curb their fertility (Coale and Hoover 1958 Enke 1960 Erhlich 1968) After a half-century, the empirical record shows crude period birthrates have declined rapidly in most parts of the low-income world, starting in the 1960s, and eventually the number of children born per woman has fallen by at least half in most countries Sub-Saharan Africa entered only in the last decade or two into its phase of sharply declining child mortality and the beginning of its fertility transition (National Research Council 2000) Total fertility rates for several regions of the world are plotted in Figure 9 2 from 1950–1955 through the median variant of the United Nations projections for 2000–2005 to illustrate these trends in fertility by region (United Nations 2003, vol 1) Figure 9 2 Total Fertility Rates by Region AGGREGATE POPULATION GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT This essay focuses only on the relationship between fertility and welfare at the individual family level, and does not deal with the difficult-to-measure indirect spillovers from fertility at the societal level In other words, if having an additional birth affects the economic well-being of others than the parents or their children, these spillovers are not considered in this essay I think it is fair to say there is no consensus on how to assess the magnitude or even determine the direction of these spillover effects of fertility and population growth on social welfare One recent review of the evidence concluded that population growth in excess of 2% per year might constitute a significant handicap limiting economic development in an impoverished country with a weak government (National Research Council 1986) By about 1990 there appears to be a negative correlation between a country’s rate of population growth and rate of economic growth in per capita income (Kelley and Schmidt 1994), but this regularity was less evident in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s Simon Kuznets (1967) has noted, as did the classical economists, that early periods of rapid population growth are often periods when per capita economic growth is above average (Smith [1776] 1961 Malthus [1789] 1993)'],\n",
