      "\n",
      "This technical report introduces Docling , an easy to use, self-contained, MITlicensed open-source package for PDF document conversion. It is powered by state-of-the-art specialized AI models for layout analysis (DocLayNet) and table structure recognition (TableFormer), and runs efficiently on commodity hardware in a small resource budget. The code interface allows for easy extensibility and addition of new features and models.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1 Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Converting PDF documents back into a machine-processable format has been a major challenge for decades due to their huge variability in formats, weak standardization and printing-optimized characteristic, which discards most structural features and metadata. With the advent of LLMs and popular application patterns such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), leveraging the rich content embedded in PDFs has become ever more relevant. In the past decade, several powerful document understanding solutions have emerged on the market, most of which are commercial software, cloud offerings [3] and most recently, multi-modal vision-language models. As of today, only a handful of open-source tools cover PDF conversion, leaving a significant feature and quality gap to proprietary solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Docling , we open-source a very capable and efficient document conversion tool which builds on the powerful, specialized AI models and datasets for layout analysis and table structure recognition we developed and presented in the recent past [12, 13, 9]. Docling is designed as a simple, self-contained python library with permissive license, running entirely locally on commodity hardware. Its code architecture allows for easy extensibility and addition of new features and models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is what Docling delivers today:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Converts PDF documents to JSON or Markdown format, stable and lightning fast\n",
      "- Understands detailed page layout, reading order, locates figures and recovers table structures\n",
      "- Extracts metadata from the document, such as title, authors, references and language\n",
      "- Optionally applies OCR, e.g. for scanned PDFs\n",
      "- Can be configured to be optimal for batch-mode (i.e high throughput, low time-to-solution) or interactive mode (compromise on efficiency, low time-to-solution)\n",
      "- Can leverage different accelerators (GPU, MPS, etc).\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2 Getting Started\n",
      "\n",
      "To use Docling, you can simply install the docling package from PyPI. Documentation and examples are available in our GitHub repository at github.com/DS4SD/docling. All required model assets 1 are downloaded to a local huggingface datasets cache on first use, unless you choose to pre-install the model assets in advance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Docling provides an easy code interface to convert PDF documents from file system, URLs or binary streams, and retrieve the output in either JSON or Markdown format. For convenience, separate methods are offered to convert single documents or batches of documents. A basic usage example is illustrated below. Further examples are available in the Doclign code repository.\n",
      "\n",
      "from docling.document\\_converter import DocumentConverter\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "source = \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01062\" # PDF path or URL converter = DocumentConverter() result = converter.convert_single(source) print(result.render_as_markdown()) # output: \"## DocLayNet: A Large Human -Annotated Dataset for Document -Layout Analysis [...]\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Optionally, you can configure custom pipeline features and runtime options, such as turning on or off features (e.g. OCR, table structure recognition), enforcing limits on the input document size, and defining the budget of CPU threads. Advanced usage examples and options are documented in the README file. Docling also provides a Dockerfile to demonstrate how to install and run it inside a container.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3 Processing pipeline\n",
      "\n",
      "Docling implements a linear pipeline of operations, which execute sequentially on each given document (see Fig. 1). Each document is first parsed by a PDF backend, which retrieves the programmatic text tokens, consisting of string content and its coordinates on the page, and also renders a bitmap image of each page to support downstream operations. Then, the standard model pipeline applies a sequence of AI models independently on every page in the document to extract features and content, such as layout and table structures. Finally, the results from all pages are aggregated and passed through a post-processing stage, which augments metadata, detects the document language, infers reading-order and eventually assembles a typed document object which can be serialized to JSON or Markdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3.1 PDF backends\n",
      "\n",
      "Two basic requirements to process PDF documents in our pipeline are a) to retrieve all text content and their geometric coordinates on each page and b) to render the visual representation of each page as it would appear in a PDF viewer. Both these requirements are encapsulated in Docling's PDF backend interface. While there are several open-source PDF parsing libraries available for python, we faced major obstacles with all of them for different reasons, among which were restrictive\n",
      "\n",
      "1 see huggingface.co/ds4sd/docling-models/\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 1: Sketch of Docling's default processing pipeline. The inner part of the model pipeline is easily customizable and extensible.\n",
      "\n",
      "<!-- image -->\n",
      "\n",
      "licensing (e.g. pymupdf [7]), poor speed or unrecoverable quality issues, such as merged text cells across far-apart text tokens or table columns (pypdfium, PyPDF) [15, 14].\n",
      "\n",
      "We therefore decided to provide multiple backend choices, and additionally open-source a custombuilt PDF parser, which is based on the low-level qpdf [4] library. It is made available in a separate package named docling-parse and powers the default PDF backend in Docling. As an alternative, we provide a PDF backend relying on pypdfium , which may be a safe backup choice in certain cases, e.g. if issues are seen with particular font encodings.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3.2 AI models\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of Docling, we initially release two highly capable AI models to the open-source community, which have been developed and published recently by our team. The first model is a layout analysis model, an accurate object-detector for page elements [13]. The second model is TableFormer [12, 9], a state-of-the-art table structure recognition model. We provide the pre-trained weights (hosted on huggingface) and a separate package for the inference code as docling-ibm-models . Both models are also powering the open-access deepsearch-experience, our cloud-native service for knowledge exploration tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Layout Analysis Model\n",
      "\n",
      "Our layout analysis model is an object-detector which predicts the bounding-boxes and classes of various elements on the image of a given page. Its architecture is derived from RT-DETR [16] and re-trained on DocLayNet [13], our popular human-annotated dataset for document-layout analysis, among other proprietary datasets. For inference, our implementation relies on the onnxruntime [5].\n",
      "\n",
      "The Docling pipeline feeds page images at 72 dpi resolution, which can be processed on a single CPU with sub-second latency. All predicted bounding-box proposals for document elements are post-processed to remove overlapping proposals based on confidence and size, and then intersected with the text tokens in the PDF to group them into meaningful and complete units such as paragraphs, section titles, list items, captions, figures or tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Table Structure Recognition\n",
      "\n",
      "The TableFormer model [12], first published in 2022 and since refined with a custom structure token language [9], is a vision-transformer model for table structure recovery. It can predict the logical row and column structure of a given table based on an input image, and determine which table cells belong to column headers, row headers or the table body. Compared to earlier approaches, TableFormer handles many characteristics of tables, such as partial or no borderlines, empty cells, rows or columns, cell spans and hierarchy both on column-heading or row-heading level, tables with inconsistent indentation or alignment and other complexities. For inference, our implementation relies on PyTorch [2].\n",
      "\n",
      "The Docling pipeline feeds all table objects detected in the layout analysis to the TableFormer model, by providing an image-crop of the table and the included text cells. TableFormer structure predictions are matched back to the PDF cells in post-processing to avoid expensive re-transcription text in the table image. Typical tables require between 2 and 6 seconds to be processed on a standard CPU, strongly depending on the amount of included table cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "## OCR\n",
      "\n",
      "Docling provides optional support for OCR, for example to cover scanned PDFs or content in bitmaps images embedded on a page. In our initial release, we rely on EasyOCR [1], a popular thirdparty OCR library with support for many languages. Docling, by default, feeds a high-resolution page image (216 dpi) to the OCR engine, to allow capturing small print detail in decent quality. While EasyOCR delivers reasonable transcription quality, we observe that it runs fairly slow on CPU (upwards of 30 seconds per page).\n",
      "\n",
      "We are actively seeking collaboration from the open-source community to extend Docling with additional OCR backends and speed improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3.3 Assembly\n",
      "\n",
      "In the final pipeline stage, Docling assembles all prediction results produced on each page into a well-defined datatype that encapsulates a converted document, as defined in the auxiliary package docling-core . The generated document object is passed through a post-processing model which leverages several algorithms to augment features, such as detection of the document language, correcting the reading order, matching figures with captions and labelling metadata such as title, authors and references. The final output can then be serialized to JSON or transformed into a Markdown representation at the users request.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3.4 Extensibility\n",
      "\n",
      "Docling provides a straight-forward interface to extend its capabilities, namely the model pipeline. A model pipeline constitutes the central part in the processing, following initial document parsing and preceding output assembly, and can be fully customized by sub-classing from an abstract baseclass ( BaseModelPipeline ) or cloning the default model pipeline. This effectively allows to fully customize the chain of models, add or replace models, and introduce additional pipeline configuration parameters. To use a custom model pipeline, the custom pipeline class to instantiate can be provided as an argument to the main document conversion methods. We invite everyone in the community to propose additional or alternative models and improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implementations of model classes must satisfy the python Callable interface. The \\_\\_call\\_\\_ method must accept an iterator over page objects, and produce another iterator over the page objects which were augmented with the additional features predicted by the model, by extending the provided PagePredictions data model accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4 Performance\n",
      "\n",
      "In this section, we establish some reference numbers for the processing speed of Docling and the resource budget it requires. All tests in this section are run with default options on our standard test set distributed with Docling, which consists of three papers from arXiv and two IBM Redbooks, with a total of 225 pages. Measurements were taken using both available PDF backends on two different hardware systems: one MacBook Pro M3 Max, and one bare-metal server running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on an Intel Xeon E5-2690 CPU. For reproducibility, we fixed the thread budget (through setting OMP NUM THREADS environment variable ) once to 4 (Docling default) and once to 16 (equal to full core count on the test hardware). All results are shown in Table 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you need to run Docling in very low-resource environments, please consider configuring the pypdfium backend. While it is faster and more memory efficient than the default docling-parse backend, it will come at the expense of worse quality results, especially in table structure recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Establishing GPU acceleration support for the AI models is currently work-in-progress and largely untested, but may work implicitly when CUDA is available and discovered by the onnxruntime and\n",
      "\n",
      "torch runtimes backing the Docling pipeline. We will deliver updates on this topic at in a future version of this report.\n",
      "\n",
      "Table 1: Runtime characteristics of Docling with the standard model pipeline and settings, on our test dataset of 225 pages, on two different systems. OCR is disabled. We show the time-to-solution (TTS), computed throughput in pages per second, and the peak memory used (resident set size) for both the Docling-native PDF backend and for the pypdfium backend, using 4 and 16 threads.\n",

      "## 5 Applications\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to the high-quality, richly structured document conversion achieved by Docling, its output qualifies for numerous downstream applications. For example, Docling can provide a base for detailed enterprise document search, passage retrieval or classification use-cases, or support knowledge extraction pipelines, allowing specific treatment of different structures in the document, such as tables, figures, section structure or references. For popular generative AI application patterns, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we provide quackling , an open-source package which capitalizes on Docling's feature-rich document output to enable document-native optimized vector embedding and chunking. It plugs in seamlessly with LLM frameworks such as LlamaIndex [8]. Since Docling is fast, stable and cheap to run, it also makes for an excellent choice to build document-derived datasets. With its powerful table structure recognition, it provides significant benefit to automated knowledge-base construction [11, 10]. Docling is also integrated within the open IBM data prep kit [6], which implements scalable data transforms to build large-scale multi-modal training datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6 Future work and contributions\n",
      "\n",
      "Docling is designed to allow easy extension of the model library and pipelines. In the future, we plan to extend Docling with several more models, such as a figure-classifier model, an equationrecognition model, a code-recognition model and more. This will help improve the quality of conversion for specific types of content, as well as augment extracted document metadata with additional information. Further investment into testing and optimizing GPU acceleration as well as improving the Docling-native PDF backend are on our roadmap, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "We encourage everyone to propose or implement additional features and models, and will gladly take your inputs and contributions under review . The codebase of Docling is open for use and contribution, under the MIT license agreement and in alignment with our contributing guidelines included in the Docling repository. If you use Docling in your projects, please consider citing this technical report.\n",

      "Despite the substantial improvements achieved with machine-learning (ML) approaches and deep neural networks in recent years, document conversion remains a challenging problem, as demonstrated by the numerous public competitions held on this topic [1-4]. The challenge originates from the huge variability in PDF documents regarding layout, language and formats (scanned, programmatic or a combination of both). Engineering a single ML model that can be applied on all types of documents and provides high-quality layout segmentation remains to this day extremely challenging [5]. To highlight the variability in document layouts, we show a few example documents from the DocLayNet dataset in Figure 1.

      "to avoid this at any cost in order to have clear, unbiased baseline numbers for human document-layout annotation. Third, we introduced the feature of snapping boxes around text segments to obtain a pixel-accurate annotation and again reduce time and effort. The CCS annotation tool automatically shrinks every user-drawn box to the minimum bounding-box around the enclosed text-cells for all purely text-based segments, which excludes only Table and Picture . For the latter, we instructed annotation staff to minimise inclusion of surrounding whitespace while including all graphical lines. A downside of snapping boxes to enclosed text cells is that some wrongly parsed PDF pages cannot be annotated correctly and need to be skipped. Fourth, we established a way to flag pages as rejected for cases where no valid annotation according to the label guidelines could be achieved. Example cases for this would be PDF pages that render incorrectly or contain layouts that are impossible to capture with non-overlapping rectangles. Such rejected pages are not contained in the final dataset. With all these measures in place, experienced annotation staff managed to annotate a single page in a typical timeframe of 20s to 60s, depending on its complexity.\n",

      "The primary goal of DocLayNet is to obtain high-quality ML models capable of accurate document-layout analysis on a wide variety of challenging layouts. As discussed in Section 2, object detection models are currently the easiest to use, due to the standardisation of ground-truth data in COCO format [16] and the availability of general frameworks such as detectron2 [17]. Furthermore, baseline numbers in PubLayNet and DocBank were obtained using standard object detection models such as Mask R-CNN and Faster R-CNN. As such, we will relate to these object detection methods in this\n",

      "\n",
      "In this section, we will present several aspects related to the performance of object detection models on DocLayNet. Similarly as in PubLayNet, we will evaluate the quality of their predictions using mean average precision (mAP) with 10 overlaps that range from 0.5 to 0.95 in steps of 0.05 (mAP@0.5-0.95). These scores are computed by leveraging the evaluation code provided by the COCO API [16].\n",

      "\n",
      "In Table 2, we present baseline experiments (given in mAP) on Mask R-CNN [12], Faster R-CNN [11], and YOLOv5 [13]. Both training and evaluation were performed on RGB images with dimensions of 1025 Ã 1025 pixels. For training, we only used one annotation in case of redundantly annotated pages. As one can observe, the variation in mAP between the models is rather low, but overall between 6 and 10% lower than the mAP computed from the pairwise human annotations on triple-annotated pages. This gives a good indication that the DocLayNet dataset poses a worthwhile challenge for the research community to close the gap between human recognition and ML approaches. It is interesting to see that Mask R-CNN and Faster R-CNN produce very comparable mAP scores, indicating that pixel-based image segmentation derived from bounding-boxes does not help to obtain better predictions. On the other hand, the more recent Yolov5x model does very well and even out-performs humans on selected labels such as Text , Table and Picture . This is not entirely surprising, as Text , Table and Picture are abundant and the most visually distinctive in a document.\n",

      "\n",
      "## 1 Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "In the United States, child workers are granted additional protection under both federal and state legislation. Companies generally may not employ anyone under the age of 14 years old. Children aged 14 and 15 are severely limited in the hours they may work per week while school is in session. 14- through 17-year-olds may not work in certain industries considered dangerous by the Department of Labor. Recent controversial events have sparked debate about the current state of US child labor laws. I review the economic analysis and ethical language surrounding two recent domestic child labor abuse stories. Pro-regulation arguments are more likely to invoke consequentialist ethical frameworks, while those seeking to loosen child labor regulations employ family values and deontological negative rights. An economic formulation of Millâs Greatest Happiness Principle provides an actionable framework for regulators to enforce a spectrum of ethical beliefs. I recommend two policy approaches to better align the law with a mature ethical reasoning toward child labor regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "An overview of this paper is as follows: in the next section, I review federal regulation governing child labor in the US. Then, I discuss why child labor abuse is considered particularly controversial and requires ethical analysis. Then, I describe two recent domestic child labor abuses. After an analysis of these two events, I propose two policy solutions aimed at better aligning the law with ethical frameworks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2 Federal Child Labor Regulation: The Fair Labor Standards Act\n",
      "\n",
      "At the turn of the 20th century, it was common for children as young as 10 years old to be employed. Approximately 20% of children aged 10 to 15 in the country were gainfully employed, according to 1900 U.S. Census data. This decreased to only around 5% by 1930. By 1940, the U.S. Census stopped recording employment data for persons under 14 years old. It was at this time that the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (âFLSAâ) was signed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FLSA provides legal definitions of âoppressive child laborâ and standards for minimum wages and working hours at the federal level. The law makes working in hazardous jobs illegal for anyone under 18, as well as 14- and 15-year-olds working in any conditions that âinterfere with their schooling and â¦ their health and well-being.â\n",
      "\n",
      "While the FLSA was meant to ensure no children were working in unsafe conditions or harming their future education, the use of child labor was already decreasing by the 1930s. State compulsory education laws passed earlier were now enforced more vigorously, requiring children (typically up to 16) to be in school for most of the year. Other factors included state child labor regulations, reduced demand for unskilled factory labor through mechanization, a large influx of adult labor supply from immigration, and improved standards of living.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 1938, the federal law governing domestic child labor has not substantially changed. In 1951, working hours for under-16-year-olds were clarified: while school is in session, no more than 3 hours per day and 18 hours per week; while out of school, no more than 8 hours per day and 40 hours per week. Many amendments to the FLSA child labor provisions have been proposed recently, but none has been successfully signed into law. However, state laws governing child labor have changed recently, which is a topic of discussion below.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3 Why is Child Labor Controversial?\n",
      "\n",
      "Before discussing whether existing child labor regulations should be changed, it is important to consider why we have child labor laws at all. The US has many existing protections in place for workers at the local, state, and federal levels. What is it about children that requires additional protection?\n",
      "\n",
      "Debra Satz explains three ethical aspects of childhood that motivate additional labor protection: weak agency, distributive inequality, and harmful outcomes. Children lack the reasoning abilities we expect of adults because they are still developing physically and mentally. As a result, an informed assessment of working conditions rests upon the parents, who may not necessarily have the childâs long-term best interests in mind. Children can reinforce or exacerbate generational economic inequality when substituting educational development with labor. This is often seen as unfair because they have no choice but to inherit the socioeconomic status of their parents. Finally, because children are in a stage of development and are expected to have a full life ahead of them, stunting that development through lack of education or through physical harm is seen as particularly wrong in society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Working is not necessarily bad for children. In fact, instilling work ethic and teaching the value of money are often seen as necessary to ensuring healthy development. Children in poor families can make a material economic impact to their living conditions through work. And parents rightly believe they should have the final say in fostering good values in their children. However, because children are unable to make fully-formed independent decisions, and because loss of development represents a potentially substantial opportunity cost, regulators should pay particularly close attention to ensuring their protection. NicolÃ¡s Brando summarizes this argument: there is nothing inherently wrong with child labor; instead, regulators should be concerned with the harms specific to children and the potentially exploitative nature of their work.\n",
      "\n",
      "The controversy surrounding child labor regulation is ultimately due to the high potential for exploitation, the perceived violations of liberty and parental governance stemming from regulation, and the particularly strong disgust elicited by abuse of the childâs well-being. Two recent incidents of child labor abuse exemplify these reactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4 Recent Domestic Child Labor Violations\n",
      "\n",
      "In July of 2022, three investigative journalists at Reuters found that SMART Alabama LLC, a subsidiary of car manufacturer Hyundai, employed several underaged children in their metal-stamping plant, a job which is considered too dangerous for children by law. The journalists interviewed a family of Guatemalan immigrants, whose father confirmed that his three children, aged 12, 14, and 15, all worked long hours in the plant with him and skipped out on school. The father explained that he regretted sending his children to work at the plant but needed the money, and that his children will attend school going forward instead of working. Following the allegations, United Auto Workers was âsaddened and disgustedâ by SMARTâs reported âabusive, exploitive practices,â and Alabama Coalition for Community Benefits wrote that its âshock turned to disgustâ when reading the allegations. The US Department of Labor sued SMART on May 30, 2024, alleging âthat a 13-year-old worked up to 50-60 hours per week on an assembly lineâ from July 2021 through early 2022. Litigation is ongoing as of February 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "A September 2023 investigative report by the New York Times detailed the stories of migrant children who worked full-time in a Perdue Farms chicken slaughterhouse in rural Virginia (a job considered dangerous and off-limits to children by law). Marcos Cux, a 14-year-old Guatemalan immigrant who entered the US without his parents, found work at a slaughterhouse after purchasing forged documents that overstated his age, along with many other children. While working the night shift, Marcosâ arm was caught in a deboning machine and was nearly torn off. Following an OSHA investigation (which did not discover the child labor), the plant reportedly âstopped letting students leave early to catch the school busâ to avoid allegations of child labor. The Department of Labor subsequently announced an investigation in February of 2024, alleging that Perdue employed at least 15 children to clean dangerous equipment in its Virginia slaughterhouse. In an April 2024 letter to Perdue CEO Donnie King, Republican Senator Bill Cassidy described the allegations as âintolerable.â In January of 2025, Perdue paid $150,000 in civil penalties and $4 million in restitution to settle allegations of âa systemic disregard for the safety of childrenâ through child labor, and agreed to employ enhanced compliance measures.\n",

      "## 5 Analysis of Recent Child Labor Violations\n",
      "\n",
      "Ethical analysis can help us understand why people might support strengthening or loosening the law in response to child labor abuse incidents. My analysis employs Wightâs âAgent-Action-Outcomeâ schema: âAn economic *agent* takes an *action* that is expected to produce certain *outcomes* . Ethical frameworks differ in their attention to different stages of this progression.â Public policies that focus on the agent employ character or virtue ethics. Policies that regulate actions fall under deontological frameworks. Finally, policies that judge an action by its outcomes are called consequentialist or utilitarian.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5.1 SMART Alabama Incident: Regulatory Order vs Family Values\n",
      "\n",
      "Child labor is often seen as controversial because the agent involved (the child) is unable to make fully-informed decisions. As a result, child workers must rely on their parents to make good decisions for them, and the role of virtues in upholding morality is even more important than with adult employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SMART Alabama and similar incidents sparked a wave of new proposals for child labor regulations, often centered around virtue ethics. Proponents of increased regulation argue that because corporations may lack virtues such as Aristotelian justice, they must be cajoled into doing âthe right thing.â Those who want to loosen child labor restrictions instead focus on family values, arguing that the decision to employ children should rest on their parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "In February of 2024, less than two years after the SMART Alabama incident was first reported, Republican state Senator Arthur Orr introduced a bill (SB53) to loosen child labor laws in Alabama. The bill eliminates the stateâs requirement for children aged 14 and 15 to obtain an âEligibility to Work Formâ from their school. The form certified that the student maintained satisfactory grades and attendance. SB53 was voted, signed, and enacted 3 months later, on May 17 (13 days before the Department of Labor would officially sue SMART).\n",
      "\n",
      "The bill shifts the burden of preventing child labor violations away from the government and toward the parents and employers. Senator Orr took this position, arguing that the government should âlet parents and children decide whatâs best for them.â He expanded his views in an interview, explaining that the FLSA and other regulations are sufficient protection for child workers:\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea that youâve got to go get permission from the government to get an after-school job, I understand why it was maybe put in place years ago, but in todayâs world with all the federal labor laws that applyâ¦ I feel comfortable that it is something that we can â¦ just leave between the parents and the child or the guardians and the child as to whether Johnny or Mary can handle it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Orrâs bill is founded on the belief that because parents *should* have virtues most aligned with their childâs success, the government has a duty to respect this role. His argument can be formulated as a ânegative right:â schools may not override the parentsâ decision. This anti-regulation stance is a pluralist combination of deontological and virtue ethics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opponents of the bill instead focused on the governmentâs duty to protect against corporate and parental egoism, and the resulting consequences of child labor abuse. The Eligibility to Work Form was a mechanism to prevent exploitation by allowing school administrators to override the parentsâ decision. One critic of the Alabama bill noted that âa 14 or 15-year-old â¦ whoâs never been in the workforce in this capacity before [] is susceptible to some real abuses,â which justifies the âguardrail.â Another critical article explained that child labor abuses are âsimply an inevitable outcome of two related trends: deteriorating social welfare and unethical corporate practices aimed at maximizing profits.â These arguments center around the *consequences* that arise from relinquishing government control. Many articles against the Alabama bill referenced the SMART Alabama incident as proof of the need for increased regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The consequentialist argument for child work permits is supported by recent research from the University of Maryland. The authors perform a cross-sectional regression analysis, comparing states without a mandated employment certificate for child labor to states with a mandate. The authors regress the log of child labor violation cases per million on a binary variable indicating whether the state uses employment certificates, plus a suite of control variables. Their base model finds that states with mandatory employment certificates have an average of 16.9% fewer child labor violation cases per capita. This result is robust to sensitivity analyses, including the use of instrumental variables regression to account for potential endogeneity. The authors did not have sufficient data to analyze the effect of Alabamaâs policy change on child labor violations since the bill was enacted so recently. Once enough data is available, an analysis of the within-state effect of SB53 would be a strong contribution to the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two sides of the debate surrounding Alabamaâs bill are an example of Kuhnâs âcrisis of paradigms,â in which a resolution cannot be reached because critics focus most of their attention on the consequences of child labor abuse, while proponents of the bill preclude consequences from their ethical approach in favor of duties and values. Bridging the parties will require a pluralist approach that can bring consequentialist research into the conversation, forming a âmature ethical reasoningâ through compromise. I believe that proponents of SB53 will only entertain such research if it can be shown to affect social values. For example, if employed 14- or 15-year-olds are more likely to develop addiction and turn to crime later in life, then this would run counter to anti-regulatorsâ beliefs and cause them to reconsider loosening child labor laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5.2 Perdue Farms Incident: A Utilitarian Win-Win?\n",
      "\n",
      "Markos Cux explained that he chose to work in a hazardous job at Perdue Farms because his family needed the money. In economic terms, the Cux family believed that the benefit of Markosâ child labor was worth the cost of his absence from school and the risk of serious injury. While Perdue Farms would not explain it this way, they implicitly performed a similar cost/benefit analysis, determining that the benefit of child labor was larger than the cost of appropriate enforcement and of being caught using the labor. Both sides employ consequentialist ethics to justify their decision, making the child labor an apparent win-win situation for Markos and Perdue Farms. So why does the government disagree? We can frame the discussion of child labor policy in economic terms using Millâs Greatest Happiness Principle.\n",
      "\n",
      "A typical economic cost/benefit analysis centers around maximizing *welfare* , in which utility (a proxy for happiness) is essentially blind to any social norms. The classical utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham argues that an action is âgoodâ if it enhances the net pleasure of society. If we restrict our analysis to just Markos and Perdue Farms, the fact that both parties chose to engage in employment reveals that the labor increased their net pleasure. Even if we broaden the scope of our analysis to include society at large, classical utilitarian analysis might classify Markosâ child labor as âgoodâ because consumers benefit from Perdueâs products.\n",

      "John Stuart Mill argues that a weakness of classical utilitarianism is its failure to consider that âsome kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others,â particularly for humanityâs higher-order faculties. Mill instead believes that utility should consider the moral aspects of certain actions. For example, the act of religious worship may not produce much utility in the classical sense, but it provides a âhigher valueâ that cannot be replaced by food or drink. Mechanically, Mill proposes that the utility of certain actions should be weighted more (or less) to align with good virtues, calling his technique the âGreatest Happiness Principle.â\n",
      "\n",
      "We can represent the Perdue incident mathematically with a Greatest Happiness Principle analysis. Suppose that Markosâ utility from working at Perdue is the difference between his hourly income (a good) and the risk-weighted costs of labor (including injury and lack of education):\n",
      "\n",
      "$$U_{M}\\left(w,h,C_{M}\\right)= w \\cdot h-C_{M} > 0$$\n",
      "\n",
      "Because Markos chose to work at Perdue, this utility is positive (revealed preference theory). Now suppose Perdue Farmsâ utility is the difference between their hourly profit from Markosâ labor (revenue minus wage) and the risk-weighted penalty for child labor abuse:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$U_{P}\\left(w,h,r,C_{P}\\right)=h \\cdot \\left(r-w\\right)-C_{P} > 0$$\n",
      "\n",
      "This difference is also assumed positive by revealed preference theory. Then the combined welfare for Markos and Perdue is the sum of their utilities:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$U_{C}=U_{M}+U_{P}= w \\cdot h-C_{M}+\\left(h \\cdot \\left(r-w\\right)-C_{P}\\right)=h \\cdot r-C_{M}-C_{P} > 0$$\n",
      "\n",
      "Now suppose an ethical regulator believes that the potential harm from Markosâ child labor ( $C_{M}$ ) should be weighted more, because depriving a child of education is morally wrong. They employ the Greatest Happiness Principle by adding a weight ( $\\alpha$ ) to the aggregate utility function:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$U_{GHP}= h \\cdot r- \\alpha  \\cdot C_{M}-C_{P},  \\alpha  > 1$$\n",
      "\n",
      "The regulator can then solve for the optimal weight  $\\alpha ^{*}$ such that the child labor is no longer attractive (utility of 0) for Markos and Perdue:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$0=h \\cdot r- \\alpha ^{*}C_{M}-C_{P}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\alpha ^{*}=(h \\cdot r-C_{P})/C_{M}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "Enacting regulation to enforce a weight of  $\\alpha ^{*}$ would in theory deter Markos from working at Perdue Farms. In other words, the economic analysis above allows a regulator to translate their ethical beliefs into a policy solution. While this analysis helps a regulator understand how they could disincentivize child labor to prevent unethical market outcomes, it doesnât explain why they would do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hardline anti-regulation, laissez-faire stance believes that the optimal weight is equal to 1 because Markos (and his parents) have the best information about his risk of injury (reflected in  $C_{M}$ ), and so the market should dictate the labor outcome. Additionally, they would argue that the unweighted analysis allows Markos to collect income ( $w \\cdot h$ ), which can be used to improve his living conditions. Preventing the child labor would guarantee a continuation of Markosâ poverty in the short term.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proponents of increased regulation have several economic reasons why the unweighted analysis is not best for society. First, the cost of a potential injury could be more damaging to the economy than Markos realizes. If Markos cannot afford the cost of healthcare, then the government might end up footing the bill for his treatment. Second, Markos might ignore the fact that work prevents him from attaining an education, which lowers his lifetime earnings potential, and is ultimately bad for both Markosâ family and the economy. Third, even if Markosâ decision is worthwhile for him, the regulator understands that his decision further solidifies intergenerational inequality. Supposing Markos implicitly discounts the lost value of his future earnings according to an interest rate  $r_{M}$ , the regulator might choose a âsocialâ interest rate  $r_{S} < r_{M}$ which considers how future generations will be affected by the decision. A lower interest rate would place more value on future earnings, stressing the high opportunity cost of forgoing those earnings on Markosâ children or grandchildren. Finally, to compensate Markos for the lack of short-term income, the government could employ forward-looking social policy that borrows from the increased future tax earnings from Markosâ education.\n",

      "## 6 Proposed Solution: Updating Civil Penalties\n",
      "\n",
      "My analysis of the SMART Alabama incident shows that the debate about child labor regulation is split due to a fundamental difference in ethical frameworks. The anti-regulation argument in favor of shifting more power to the parents seems reasonable. However, my discussion of the Perdue Farms incident shows that the incentives of the family and employer are misaligned with macroeconomic success. My recommendation is to update existing federal policy to align with consequentialist ethics, using the Greatest Happiness Principle to ânudgeâ self-interested parties away from child labor. Increasing the FLSA civil penalties for child labor violations would strike the balance between deterring future abuse and retaining the liberty of choice for the family. I discuss two examples of how policymakers can set optimal fines to deter violations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Corporations generally act in their self-interest; they pursue an action if they believe it will maximize profits. An optimal civil penalty would make the pursuit of illegal child labor unprofitable for the firm. For example, suppose meatpacking firm XYZ hires 10 children, paying them $10 per hour and earning an expected $20 per hour from their work. Assume that the children each work for 2 years, working 50 40-hour weeks (2000 hours) per year. The total value of their labor is $400,000. The current FLSA civil penalty is $11,000 per child, so the expected value of getting caught is only $110,000 *with a 100% detection rate* . Since the true detection rate is less than 100%, it is clearly profitable for the firm to employ children, which justifies breaking the law. Supposing a more reasonable detection rate of 20%, illegal child labor would be profitable unless the penalty were raised to $200,000 per child, or approximately *18 times the current penalty* . Informed regulators would perform the necessary research to make these calculations realistic, but they would likely come to the same conclusion: the current penalty is not sufficient to deter illegal conduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "An alternative (or additional) approach would require a firm to compensate the child worker for the net present value lost as a result of the illegal labor. Quantifying the lost value of a child skipping school or experiencing mental hardship is difficult, but an approximation has been established by academic research. A 2015 study found that the net present value of lifetime earnings for high school graduates was 0.66 million vs 0.48 million for less-than-high school graduates, a difference of $180,000. Even if the child was physically unharmed by working illegally, they may have lost substantial lifetime earnings by skipping out on school. It is possible that this penalty would not be sufficient to deter corporations from employing child labor. However, the benefit of this policy would be to reduce intergenerational inequality. Children who were forced into child labor by their families would regain the socioeconomic mobility they lost by missing educational opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7 Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of child labor is and will always remain controversial. This is due to the risk of exploitation inherent to childhood, the drastic consequences for both the child and future generations, and the difficult tradeoff between government regulation and parental rights. But it is also due to a fundamental difference in ethical reasoning employed by the two sides of the policy debate. Bridging the ethical divide will require research on the effects of loosened regulations on family values. I use a mathematical formulation of the decision to allow illegal child labor to focus the economic arguments for and against regulation. Employing principles of economic self-interest, I explain how policies should be updated to align the incentives of children, their family, the corporations, and the social planner. These policy solutions balance the aspects of parental control with the negative consequences of child labor abuse.\n",

      "Use the Greatest Happiness Principle to 'nudge' self-interested parties away from child labor\n",

      "\n",
      "## Recommendation 1: Self-Interest Approach\n",
      "\n",
      "- Corporations pursue actions that will maximize profits\n",
      "- Current FLSA civil penalty is $11,000 per child, which means it is likely profitable for a firm to illegally employ children\n",
      "- Penalty should be raised until the expected profit of using child labor is $0 or less. Example:\n",
      "- Firm hires 10 children, profiting $400,000 over 2 years\n",
      "- Penalty is only $110,000 with 100% detection rate , too low\n",
      "- Since detection rate is &lt; 100%, penalty should be even higher\n",
      "- Informed regulators would perform research to calibrate the penalty appropriately.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendation 2: Inequality Reduction\n",
      "\n",
      "- Even if uninjured, child laborers lose out on education, which is costly\n",
      "- 2015 study: NPV of lifetime earnings for high school grads is $180,000 higher than less-than-high school grads\n",
      "- This loss of future income solidifies intergenerational inequality\n",
      "- Penalty should be updated to compensate children for loss of education\n",
      "- Can increase to account for &lt; 100% detection rate\n",
      "- Child laborers would regain their lost socioeconomic mobility\n",
      "- This also supports long-term economic progress\n",
