If these regulations are optimal, their marginal benefit of addressing externalities should equal their marginal cost of distorting risk-sharing These risk-sharing distortions will manifest as trading opportunities that intermediaries are unable to exploit Focusing in particular on arbitrage opportunities, I construct an “externality-mimicking portfolio” whose returns track the externalities that would rationalize existing regulations as optimal I conduct a revealedpreference exercise using this portfolio and test whether the recovered externalities are sensible I find that the signs of existing CIP violations are inconsistent with optimal policy Benjamin M Hébert Graduate School of Business Stanford University 655 Knight Way Stanford, CA 94305 and NBER bhebert stanford edu Following the great ﬁnancial crisis (GFC), apparent arbitrage opportunities emerged in ﬁnancial markets These arbitrage opportunities, such as the gap between the federal funds rate and the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate, or violations of covered interest rate parity (CIP), are notable in part because they have persisted for years after the peak of the ﬁnancial crisis Authors such as Du et al (2018) have argued that macro-prudential regulations put in place after the GFC have enabled these arbitrages to exist and persist If these apparent arbitrages opportunities are made possible by macro-prudential"}

More generally, what can be learned from the patterns of arbitrage across assets induced by regulation? Can we use these patterns to assess whether macro-prudential regulations are having their intended effects? Suppose we observe the price of an asset a that is traded by both intermediaries and households, and the price of another asset a′ with identical payoffs that is traded by intermediaries only If the prices of a and a′ are not equal, an apparent arbitrage exists Such an opportunity can exist in equilibrium if intermediaries are bound by a constraint that treats a and a′ differently (say, because it treats derivatives and cash assets differently) Let us further suppose that this constraint exists because of regulation– it is a leverage constraint, capital control, or some other kind of policy Now imagine that a household approaches an intermediary and wishes to buy asset a The intermediary contemplates selling asset a to the household and hedging by purchasing asset a′ If the price of a is higher than the price of a′, this arbitrage trade is proﬁtable the intermediary would execute the trade if unconstrained From this we can infer, as outside observers, that regulation is constraining the extent to which the intermediary can sell the asset a to the household That is, the regulation 1 is keeping the risks associated with asset a within the intermediary sector instead of allowing those risks to be transferred to the household sector We can then adopt a macro-prudential"}

Equivalently, what risks are pushed by regulation into the intermediary sector and what risks are pushed by regulation into the household sector? The key step in the analysis is the construction of what I call the “externality-mimicking portfolio ” This portfolio’s returns are an estimate of the externalities that would justify the observed patterns of arbitrage, or equivalently an estimate of the effect of regulation on risk-sharing between households and intermediaries I construct this portfolio using CIP violations In the context of CIP violations, the assets a and a′ are combinations of bond and exchange rate transactions Empirically, the sign of the observed arbitrage, as documented by Du et al (2018), is related to the direction of the carry trade– it is more expensive for the household to execute the carry trade than it is for the intermediary to replicate the carry trade using currency forwards Consequently, I infer that the relevant regulatory constraint(s) have the effect of keeping carry trade risk within the intermediary sector, instead of allowing intermediaries to transfer those risks to households This result is surprising given the risky nature of the carry trade The basic issue is"}

{"id":60,"text":"and invest enough cash at the IOER rate over the next month to cover the exercise price of the put/call Regardless of whether the ETF ends up above or below the strike price, the intermediary will end up owning the ETF in one month The particular details of this arbitrage are complicated by the fact that the SPY options are “American” and not “European” options, meaning they can be exercised at any time I deal with this issue by employing the Margrabe (1978) bound on American put prices, which in my setting (short time horizons and low interest rates) is reasonably tight I discuss this issue in more detail below The ETF and the replicating portfolio will generate identical payoffs as long as there are no dividends over the course of the month (more precisely, that an exdividend date does not occur within the month) The ETF has ex-dividend dates quarterly, usually on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December 40 40The prospectus, available at https //us spdrs com/librarycontent/public/SPDR 500%20TRUST PROSPECTUS pdf, describes the details of how the ex-dividend dates are determined 55 I therefore limit my sample to avoid these dates This illustrates one of the two main advantages the ETF-based arbitrage has over the traditional S P 500 cash-futures arbitrage The stocks of the S P 500 index pay dividends often, and hence most studies of index arbitrage assume either perfect foresight of dividends or use a dividend forecast, whereas no such assumptions are required for the ETF arbitrage The second advantage relates to transactions costs and stale prices The traditional index arbitrage involves buying and selling 500 stocks, generating substantial transactions costs and exacerbating the issue that prices might not be synchronized Using"}

{"id":534,"text":"providers bear a negative exposure to market volatility Since market volatility carries a large negative price of risk in option markets (Carr and Wu, 2008), the negative exposure of liquidity providers explains why liquidity provision earns a substantial premium (Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2015), why this premium increases with volatility (Nagel, 2012), and why liquidity contracts during crises (Brunnermeier, 2009) By integrating liquidity and volatility, our results provide a new perspective on the risks and returns to liquidity provision Why do liquidity providers have a negative exposure to market volatility? The basic problem liquidity providers face is adverse selection by investors with private information In standard models (e g Kyle, 1985), the quantity of private information in the market is constant and known to liquidity providers It therefore poses no risk to them While this is a simple assumption, it is clearly unrealistic Volatility, the observed end-product of the ﬂow of information, is highly time-varying, both at the level of individual assets and for the market as a whole Moreover, the volatilities of individual assets covary strongly with each other and with market volatility This suggests that ﬂows of information, both public and private, vary substantially over time and in a synchronous manner To capture this co-movement, we extend the model of Kyle (1985) by making the amounts of market and private information uncertain and positively correlated Because of this correlation, market volatility informs liquidity providers about the amount of private information they face In particular, an increase in market volatility leads them to estimate a greater amount of private information As in Kyle (1985), liquidity providers’ estimate of private information determines how much they"}
{"id":535,"text":"amount of private information As in Kyle (1985), liquidity providers’ estimate of private information determines how much they adjust prices in the direction of the net order ﬂow they receive If their estimate is too low, they adjust prices too little, and because of adverse selection trade too much with informed investors They then accumulate long positions at prices that are too high and short positions at prices that are too low Now consider what happens when there is a positive shock to market volatility The shock increases liquidity providers’ estimate of private information Liquidity providers learn that they had not adjusted prices enough and likely traded too much with informed investors Prices immediately come to reﬂect this Liquidity providers see their long 1 positions fall and their short positions rise, taking losses across the portfolio The opposite happens when a negative shock hits liquidity providers’ estimate of private information declines, their longs rise and their shorts fall In sum, liquidity providers have a negative exposure to market volatility In existing models of liquidity provision, which focus on inventory risk (e g , Stoll, 1978 Grossman and Miller, 1988), a liquidity provider’s risk is idiosyncratic To explain the liquidity premium these models assume that some friction prevents the liquidity provider from diversifying this risk away While this may apply in some cases, particularly for small and thinly-traded assets, it is unlikely to explain the liquidity premium among large and heavily-traded assets In our model liquidity providers face a systematic risk (ﬂuctuations in market volatility) that cannot be diversiﬁed away We thus need to specify how this risk is priced by the economy’s stochastic discount factor Consistent with the"}

The literature on the variance risk premium emphasizes the fundamental macroeconomic risks faced by a representative agent Yet it is also possible that the variance risk premium itself is a reﬂection of the importance of the ﬁnancial sector in the economy This possibility is intriguing, as it promises to further integrate the asset pricing and ﬁnancial intermediation literatures 39 References Acharya, Viral V, and Lasse Heje Pedersen 2005 “Asset pricing with liquidity risk ” Journal of ﬁnancial Economics, 77(2) 375–410 Admati, Anat R, and Paul Pﬂeiderer 1988 “A theory of intraday patterns Volume and price variability ” The Review of Financial Studies, 1(1) 3–40 Adrian, Tobias, and Hyun Song Shin 2010 “Liquidity and leverage ” Journal of ﬁnancial intermediation, 19(3) 418–437 Amihud, Yakov 2002 “Illiquidity and stock returns cross-section and time-series effects ” Journal of ﬁnancial markets, 5(1) 31–56 Amihud, Yakov, and Haim Mendelson 1986 “Asset pricing and the bid-ask spread ” Journal of ﬁnancial Economics, 17(2) 223–249 Andersen, Torben G, Nicola Fusari, and Viktor Todorov 2015 “The risk premia embedded in index options ” Journal of Financial Economics, 117(3) 558–584 Avramov, Doron, Tarun Chordia, and Amit Goyal 2006 “Liquidity and autocorrelations in individual stock returns ” The Journal of ﬁnance, 61(5) 2365–2394 Bao, Jack,"}

To think about this, suppose we lost the pollinating insects, bird and bats that currently bring us about one third of our food There are two questions we can ask What would be the cost of replacing them?

German and French researchers recently estimated that worldwide the loss of all pollinators would lead to a drop in annual agricultural output of about $217 billion, a truly huge sum 3 But vast as it is, this again may be an underestimate of the value of pollinators They pollinate wild plants as well as crops, so their absence would have an impact on wild ecosystems, which in turn could have economic consequences A subtler point is that even if we were to lose $217 billion dollars of food from the absence of pollinators, that missing food might actually be worth a lot more to us than its market value Suppose for example that we lost an apple crop for which we currently pay $1 million, and other fruits – peaches, grapes, oranges, lemons etc – worth another $5 million Is the total value of our loss $6 million?

{"id":811,"text":"COVID-19 and both bank deposits and deposit interest rates Given welldocumented differences in COVID-19 infection rates across U S counties and assuming that these differences translate into cross-county differences in concerns about future income, the precautionary savings view suggests a positive relation between COVID-19 cases and bank deposits at the county level Furthermore, the COVID-19 driven increase in local deposits will reduce local deposit interest rates, as long as there is some segmentation of banking markets Although past research provides mixed evidence on the importance of precautionary savings (e g , Dynan 1993 Starr-McCluer 1996 Carroll and Samwick 1998 Engen and Gruber 2001, Agarwal and Qian 2014 D’Acunto et al 2020), we make an initial effort to evaluate the precautionary savings view in the context of a pandemic such as the COVID-19 using granular and high frequency data Second, the “flight-to-safety” view stresses that adverse financial market shocks induce people to flee from risky investments and into the safety of bank deposits (e g , Bernanke Gertler, and Gilchrist 1996 Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein 2002 Gatev and Strahan 2 2006 Cornett et al 2011), while stock market booms are associated with a reduction in households’ demand for deposits (Lin 2019) When applied to the COVID-19 pandemic, this flight-to-safety view suggests that COVID-19 triggered financial market panic that prompted investors to allocate more of their savings to deposits The COVID-19 crisis, however, is qualitatively different from the crises underlying past flight-to-safety studies, because the COVID-19 crisis did not originate as a shock to the financial sector Thus, past research on"}

{"id":865,"text":"begun to mandate employer−provided PSL As of October 2023, 14 states plus the District of Columbia (referred to as a ‘state’ below) have adopted or announced a PSL mandate (National Partnership for Women Families, 2023) These mandates require employers to provide, on average, seven days of PSL per year (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2021), granting access to PSL benefits to 21 million employees (National Partnership for Women Families, 2023),1 and increasing generosity of the benefit for many other employees Previous economic studies show that these mandates increase PSL access and use, increase healthcare received, and improve health (e g , by reducing infectious disease), but do not lead employers to curtail wages or other valuable benefits (see Section 2 2) In contrast to concerns sometimes raised by critiques of requiring PSL benefits (Copland, 2013), these mandates are also not overly costly to employers 1Assuming each employee has two dependents, these PSL mandates would result in over 60 million persons (employees and dependents) living in households covered through PSL for the first time 2 We extend the literature examining U S PSL mandates by investigating their impact on birth rates Understanding these effects is important because, while birth rates have been declining for decades (Buckles et al , 2022 Kearney et al , 2022), 40% of pregnancies occur earlier than intended or when no pregnancy is desired (Kost and Lindberg, 2015) Such pregnancies most commonly reflect a failure to use effective contraception (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023b) On the other hand, 19% of married women 15−49 years old experience infertility each year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023a)2 and nearly 13% of reproductive age women receive"}

{"id":1108,"text":"operated as a natural filter, excluding bacteria and other suspended solids from the water This plant came into effect in 1899 Later, starting in 1909, water was further treated with calcium hypochlorite, and beginning in year 1916, with liquid chlorine (Logsdon Lippy, 1982) In Cincinnati, OH, water filtration was implemented using a Rapid Sand Filtration technique (a water purification technique that involves passing water through a bed of sand to remove impurities and particles quickly) in 1907 It then was complemented with water chlorination in 1915 4 During these decades, the country saw a diverse array of materials used in water pipe systems Cast iron pipes and galvanized steel, protected by a zinc coating, were largely used for their durability, longevity, and resistance to corrosion Another material in high demand for water pipes was lead Several technical factors and relative advantages of lead over its alternatives made it more popular across the country Lead water pipes could be tightly sealed, reducing the probability of leaks and ensuring a consistent flow of water They were also easy to install, and plumbers were familiar with its features Other reasons were their durability, availability, and corrosion resistance In many cities, an alloy of elements including lead and iron were used Further, copper, brass, and clay pipes also had their roles, with copper gaining favor for indoor plumbing due to its corrosion resistance, while clay pipes persisted in sewer systems in some regions"}

A first step has been conducted in the volume edited by Coile et al (2019) Their research suggests that while better health, more education, and changes in labor supply behavior of married couples may have played some role in this trend reversal, these factors alone are insufficient to explain the magnitude of the employment increase and its large variation across countries On the demand side, their analysis also concludes that unemployment is not a major driver of labor force participation trends The analysis does not directly examine other factors that could affect the demand for older workers, such as globalization and automation, and indeed there is as yet little research in this area (National Academies, 2022) By contrast, the literature has been more definitive in dispelling the “lump of labor fallacy” that there is a given amount of paid work to be done in a country at a given time, including analysis by"}

{"id":1266,"text":"at scale, little is known about their impacts on child outcomes in the longer-term, and which children benefit the most A notable exception is a parenting intervention developed and evaluated in Jamaica (Grantham-McGregor et al , 1991), that led to strong short-term and long-term impacts for particularly vulnerable children (Gertler et al , 2014) Beyond this, few such programs are followed up in the longer term, (Jeong et al , 2021b) particularly in LMICs, including those with larger sample sizes and scalability in mind In this paper, we partly fill this gap by presenting medium run impacts of an ECD intervention focusing on parenting, and implemented in the slums of Cuttack, a mid-sized Indian city in the eastern state of Odisha The intervention we evaluate was designed to be scalable, both in terms of cost and the approach to delivery, which is based on local community workers The slum residents are an important population to consider They were typically migrants from rural areas with limited local support networks and are extremely poor However, as baseline data confirmed, they had high aspirations for their children We can thus expect them to be open to interventions to improve human development for their 1 children, which might increase their motivation to engage with the program Our focus is on ECD because it is well established that deficits in child development, once they have set in, are hard to reverse and thus play a key role in the intergenerational transmission of poverty Millions of children around the world are at risk of not achieving their potential because of their exposure to poverty and deprivation, making it a major social and public health problem"}

{"id":1299,"text":"Gong et al 2019) Thus, it is imperative for policymakers to understand the effects of ED closures on health outcomes when considering the consequences of hospital consolidation and closures in rural communities In this paper, we study how losing access to hospital-based ED services affects mortality in rural U S counties, focusing on mortality from behavioral health and time-sensitive conditions We argue that there are close links between ED closures and these types of mortality First, EDs often serve as safety-net providers for people with mental health and substance abuse (MH/SA) disorders since rural areas tend to lack specialized behavioral health services (Wishner, 2016 Holland et al 2021) As of 2022, 66 percent of US residents in rural communities lived in areas classified as mental health provider shortage areas (HRSA, 2019) When a rural community loses hospital-based ED services, there may be no alternative place to obtain care for acute events related to MH/SA As of 2019, there were 8 million SArelated ED visits in the US (28 5 SA-related ED visits per 1,000 population), comprising about 6 percent of all ED visits, with about a third of these visits leading to inpatient stays (Owens Moore, 2022) Thus, one mechanism through which ED closure may affect health is the loss of acute care for behavioral health-related needs Second, lack of access to a nearby ED may impede access to care if patients need to travel farther to access services In a study of 64 rural hospitals that closed between 2013 and 2017 and had offered ED"}

{"id":1324,"text":"(Lindrooth et al 2018) Consistently, Table B1 reports that compared to rural counties in states that had expanded Medicaid by 2019, rural counties in states that had not yet 17 expanded Medicaid as of 2019 have a 3 7 percentage point increase in the probability of experiencing loss of ED services 9 Until recently, ED closures in rural areas continue to be a topic of high policy relevance at the federal level In December 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 established a new provider type called “Rural Emergency Hospitals” (REHs) Starting in 2023, some rural hospitals, including CAHs, will be able to convert to REHs, which will be facilities providing outpatient hospital and ED services without offering inpatient services For some services, REHs will receive higher Medicare reimbursement rates for the services provided than would be the case if the services were provided in a hospital The idea behind REHs is to maintain ED services even when a rural community can no longer support a full-service hospital (Pink et al , 2021) There is already concern among rural hospitals, however, that Medicare’s REH program will cause rural communities to lose needed inpatient services, potentially a disaster if nearby hospitals are too crowded to accept inpatient transfers 10 In addition to REHs, there are a growing number of freestanding emergency departments (FSEDs) in the US, which are 24/7 emergency facilities that are not physically connected to a hospital with inpatient services As of 2016, 11 percent of EDs in the US were considered freestanding (Medpac, 2019) REHs"}

{"id":1340,"text":"47 percent since 2013, according to the 2023 Kaiser Family Foundation Employer Health Benefits Survey (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2023a)   In theory, consolidation in health insurance markets can have opposing effects on premiums On the one hand, consolidation may result in lower premiums because consolidation leads to scale economies and to insurers having stronger negotiating power against health care providers, which potentially lowers premiums (see, for example, Melnick et al 2011 and Scheffler and Arnold 2017 for evidence on commercial insurance) On the other hand, consolidation in insurer markets can lead to higher premiums because of market power (see Dafny et al 2012 and Trish and Herring 2015 for evidence on commercial insurance Dafny et al 2015 for evidence on ACA Marketplace plans) Prior empirical research shows mixed effects of insurer market consolidation on premiums (see evidence in Scheffler et al 2016 for ACA Marketplace plans Ho and Lee 2017 for commercial insurance Chorniy et al 2020 and Hill and Wagner 2021 for Medicare Part D) We know much less, however, about the effects of insurer market consolidation on outcomes measured at the individual level – such as insurance enrollment decisions and individual drug expenditures - which are closely related to consumers’ wellbeing   Our study, focused on the Medicare Part D stand-alone PDP market, is of particular interest for two reasons First, Part D is crucial in providing financial security for older people to access their outpatient prescription drugs As of 2023, more than 50"}
