Since 1 April 2014, it has also funded the BBC World Service (launched in 1932 as the BBC Empire Service), which broadcasts in 28 languages and provides comprehensive TV, radio, and online services in Arabic and Persian. Some of the BBC's revenue comes from its commercial subsidiary BBC Studios (formerly BBC Worldwide), which sells BBC programmes and services internationally and also distributes the BBC's international 24-hour English-language news services BBC News, and from BBC.com, provided by BBC Global News Ltd.[13][14] In 2009, the company was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise in recognition of its international achievements in business.[15] Since its formation in 1922, the BBC has played a prominent role in British life and culture.[16] It is sometimes informally referred to as the Beeb or Auntie.[17][18] In 1923 it launched Radio Times (subtitled \"The official organ of the BBC\"), the first broadcast listings magazine; the 1988 Christmas edition sold 11 million copies, the biggest-selling edition of any British magazine in history.[19]\n",

    "History\n",
    "For a chronological guide, see Timeline of the BBC.\n",
    "The birth of British broadcasting, 1920 to 1922\n",
    "Britain's first live public broadcast was made from the factory of Marconi Company in Chelmsford in June 1920. It was sponsored by the Daily Mail's Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe and featured the famous Australian soprano Dame Nellie Melba. The Melba broadcast caught the people's imagination and marked a turning point in the British public's attitude to radio.[20]: 47  However, this public enthusiasm was not shared in official circles where such broadcasts were held to interfere with important military and civil communications. By late 1920, the pressure from these quarters and uneasiness among the staff of the licensing authority, the General Post Office (GPO), was sufficient to lead to a ban on further Chelmsford broadcasts.[20]: 50 \n",
    "\n",
    "But by 1922, the GPO had received nearly 100 broadcast licence requests[21]: 110  and moved to rescind its ban in the wake of a petition by 63 wireless societies with over 3,000 members.[20]: 50–97  Anxious to avoid the same chaotic expansion experienced in the United States, the GPO proposed that it would issue a single broadcasting licence to a company jointly owned by a consortium of leading wireless receiver manufacturers, to be known as the British Broadcasting Company Ltd, which was formed on 18 October 1922.[22] John Reith, a Scottish Calvinist, was appointed its general manager in December 1922 a few weeks after the company made its first official broadcast.[21]: 110  L. Stanton Jefferies was its first director of music.[23] The company was to be financed by a royalty on the sale of BBC wireless receiving sets from approved domestic manufacturers.[24] To this day, the BBC aims to follow the Reithian directive to \"inform, educate and entertain\".[25]\n",
    "\n",
    "From private company towards public service corporation, 1923 to 1926\n",
    "\n",
    "The first issue of the Radio Times (28 September 1923)\n",
    "The financial arrangements soon proved inadequate. Set sales were disappointing as amateurs made their own receivers and listeners bought rival unlicensed sets.[20]: 146  By mid-1923, discussions between the GPO and the BBC had become deadlocked and the Postmaster General commissioned a review of broadcasting by the Sykes Committee.[26] The committee recommended a short-term reorganisation of licence fees with improved enforcement in order to address the BBC's immediate financial distress, and an increased share of the licence revenue split between it and the GPO. This was to be followed by a simple 10 shillings licence fee to fund broadcasts.[26] The BBC's broadcasting monopoly was made explicit for the duration of its current broadcast licence, as was the prohibition on advertising. To avoid competition with newspapers, Fleet Street persuaded the government to ban news bulletins before 7 pm and the BBC was required to source all news from external wire services.[26] The Radio Times, the world's first and longest-running radio and television listings magazine, was launched by Reith in September 1923.[19] The first edition, subtitled \"The official organ of the BBC\", was priced at tuppence (two pence) on newsstands, and quickly sold out its run of a quarter of a million copies.[27]\n",
    "\n",
    "Mid-1925 found the future of broadcasting under further consideration, this time by the Crawford committee. By now, the BBC, under Reith's leadership, had forged a consensus favouring a continuation of the unified (monopoly) broadcasting service, but more money was still required to finance rapid expansion. Wireless manufacturers were anxious to exit the loss-making consortium, and Reith was keen that the BBC be seen as a public service rather than a commercial enterprise. The recommendations of the Crawford Committee were published in March the following year and were still under consideration by the GPO when the 1926 United Kingdom general strike broke out in May. The strike temporarily interrupted newspaper production, and with restrictions on news bulletins waived, the BBC suddenly became the primary source of news for the duration of the crisis.[21]: 117 \n",
    "\n",
    "The crisis placed the BBC in a delicate position. On the one hand Reith was acutely aware that the government might exercise its right to commandeer the BBC at any time as a mouthpiece of the government if the BBC were to step out of line, but on the other he was anxious to maintain public trust by appearing to be acting independently. The government was divided on how to handle the BBC, but ended up trusting Reith, whose opposition to the strike mirrored the PM's own. Although Winston Churchill in particular wanted to commandeer the BBC to use it \"to the best possible advantage\", Reith wrote that Stanley Baldwin's government wanted to be able to say \"that they did not commandeer [the BBC], but they know that they can trust us not to be really impartial\".[28] Thus the BBC was granted sufficient leeway to pursue the government's objectives largely in a manner of its own choosing. Supporters of the strike nicknamed the BBC the BFC for British Falsehood Company. Reith personally announced the end of the strike which he marked by reciting from Blake's \"Jerusalem\" signifying that England had been saved.[29]\n",
    "\n",
    "While the BBC tends to characterise its coverage of the general strike by emphasising the positive impression created by its balanced coverage of the views of government and strikers, Seaton has characterised the episode as the invention of \"modern propaganda in its British form\".[21]: 117  Reith argued that trust gained by 'authentic impartial news' could then be used. Impartial news was not necessarily an end in itself.[21]: 118 \n",
    "\n",
    "The BBC did well out of the crisis, which cemented a national audience for its broadcasting, and it was followed by the Government's acceptance of the recommendation made by the Crawford Committee (1925–26) that the British Broadcasting Company be replaced by a non-commercial, Crown-chartered organisation: the British Broadcasting Corporation.[26]\n",

    "The British Broadcasting Corporation came into existence on 1 January 1927, and Reith – newly knighted – was appointed its first director general. To represent its purpose and (stated) values, the new corporation adopted the coat of arms, including the motto \"Nation shall speak peace unto Nation\".[32]\n",
    "\n",
    "British radio audiences had little choice apart from the upscale programming of the BBC. Reith, an intensely moralistic executive, was in full charge. His goal was to broadcast \"All that is best in every department of human knowledge, endeavour and achievement.... The preservation of a high moral tone is obviously of paramount importance.\"[33] Reith succeeded in building a high wall against an American-style free-for-all in radio in which the goal was to attract the largest audiences and thereby secure the greatest advertising revenue. There was no paid advertising on the BBC; all the revenue came from a tax on receiving sets. Highbrow audiences, however, greatly enjoyed it.[34] At a time when American, Australian and Canadian stations were drawing huge audiences cheering for their local teams with the broadcast of baseball, rugby and hockey, the BBC emphasised service for a national rather than a regional audience. Boat races were well covered along with tennis and horse racing, but the BBC was reluctant to spend its severely limited air time on long football or cricket games, regardless of their popularity.[35]\n",

    "The BBC's radio studio in Birmingham, from the BBC Hand Book 1928, which described it as \"Europe's largest studio\"\n",
    "John Reith and the BBC, with support from the Crown, determined the universal needs of the people of Britain and broadcast content according to these perceived standards.[36] Reith effectively censored anything that he felt would be harmful, directly or indirectly.[37] While recounting his time with the BBC in 1935, Raymond Postgate claims that BBC broadcasters were made to submit a draft of their potential broadcast for approval. It was expected that they tailored their content to accommodate the modest, church-going elderly or a member of the Clergy.[38] Until 1928, entertainers broadcasting on the BBC, both singers and \"talkers\" were expected to avoid biblical quotations, Clerical impersonations and references, references to drink or Prohibition in the United States, vulgar and doubtful matter and political allusions.[37] The BBC excluded popular foreign music and musicians from its broadcasts, while promoting British alternatives.[39] On 5 March 1928, Stanley Baldwin, the Prime Minister, maintained the censorship of editorial opinions on public policy, but allowed the BBC to address matters of religious, political or industrial controversy.[40] The resulting political \"talk series\", designed to inform England on political issues, were criticised by members of parliament, including Winston Churchill, David Lloyd George and Sir Austen Chamberlain. Those who opposed these chats claimed that they silence the opinions of those in Parliament who are not nominated by Party Leaders or Party Whips, thus stifling independent, non-official views.[40] In October 1932, the policemen of the Metropolitan Police Federation marched in protest at a proposed pay cut. Fearing dissent within the police force and public support for the movement, the BBC censored its coverage of the events, only broadcasting official statements from the government.[40]\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the 1930s, political broadcasts had been closely monitored by the BBC.[41] In 1935, the BBC censored the broadcasts of Oswald Mosley and Harry Pollitt.[40] Mosley was a leader of the British Union of Fascists, and Pollitt a leader of the Communist Party of Great Britain. They had been contracted to provide a series of five broadcasts on their parties' politics. The BBC, in conjunction with The Foreign Office of Britain, first suspended this series and ultimately cancelled it without the notice of the public.[41][40] Less radical politicians faced similar censorship. In 1938, Winston Churchill proposed a series of talks regarding British domestic and foreign politics and affairs but was similarly censored.[41] The censorship of political discourse by the BBC was a precursor to the total shutdown of political debate that manifested over the BBC's wartime airwaves.[41] The Foreign Office maintained that the public should not be aware of their role in the censorship.[40] From 1935 to 1939, the BBC also attempted to unite the British Empire's radio waves, sending staff to Egypt, Palestine, Newfoundland, Jamaica, India, Canada and South Africa.[42] Reith personally visited South Africa, lobbying for state-run radio programmes which was accepted by South African Parliament in 1936.[42] A similar programme was adopted in Canada. Through collaboration with these state-run broadcasting centres, Reith left a legacy of cultural influence across the empire of Great Britain with his departure from the corporation in 1938.[42]\n",
    "\n",
    "Experimental television broadcasts were started in 1929, using an electromechanical 30-line system developed by John Logie Baird.[43] Limited regular broadcasts using this system began in 1932, and an expanded service (now named the BBC Television Service) started from Alexandra Palace in November 1936, alternating between an improved Baird mechanical 240-line system and the all-electronic 405-line Marconi-EMI system which had been developed by an EMI research team led by Sir Isaac Shoenberg.[44] The superiority of the electronic system saw the mechanical system dropped early the following year, with the Marconi-EMI system the first fully electronic television system in the world to be used in regular broadcasting.[45]\n",

    "The success of broadcasting provoked animosities between the BBC and well-established media such as theatres, concert halls and the recording industry. By 1929, the BBC complained that the agents of many comedians refused to sign contracts for broadcasting, because they feared it harmed the artist \"by making his material stale\" and that it \"reduces the value of the artist as a visible music-hall performer\". On the other hand, the BBC was \"keenly interested\" in a cooperation with the recording companies who \"in recent years ... have not been slow to make records of singers, orchestras, dance bands, etc. who have already proved their power to achieve popularity by wireless.\" Radio plays were so popular that the BBC had received 6,000 manuscripts by 1929, most of them written for stage and of little value for broadcasting: \"Day in and day out, manuscripts come in, and nearly all go out again through the post, with a note saying 'We regret, etc.'\"[46] In the 1930s music broadcasts also enjoyed great popularity, for example the friendly and wide-ranging BBC Theatre Organ broadcasts at St George's Hall, London by Reginald Foort, who held the official role of BBC Staff Theatre Organist from 1936 to 1938.[47]\n",

    "Television broadcasting was suspended from 1 September 1939 to 7 June 1946, during the World War II, and it was left to BBC Radio broadcasters such as Reginald Foort to keep the nation's spirits up. The BBC moved most of its radio operations out of London, initially to Bristol, and then to Bedford. Concerts were broadcast from the Bedford Corn Exchange; the Trinity Chapel in St Paul's Church, Bedford was the studio for the daily service from 1941 to 1945, and, in the darkest days of the war in 1941, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York came to St Paul's to broadcast to the UK and the world on the National Day of Prayer. BBC employees during the war included George Orwell who spent two years with the broadcaster.[48]\n",

    "During his role as prime minister during the war, Winston Churchill delivered 33 major wartime speeches by radio, all of which were carried by the BBC within the UK.[49] On 18 June 1940, French general Charles de Gaulle, in exile in London as the leader of the Free French, made a speech, broadcast by the BBC, urging the French people not to capitulate to the Nazis.[50] In October 1940, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret made their first radio broadcast for the BBC's Children's Hour, addressing other children who had been evacuated from cities.[51]\n",

    "In 1938, John Reith and the Government of the United Kingdom, specifically the Ministry of Information which had been set up for WWII, designed a censorship apparatus for the inevitability of war.[52] Due to the BBC's advancements in shortwave radio technology, the corporation could broadcast across the world during the Second World War.[53] Within Europe, the BBC European Service would gather intelligence and information regarding the current events of the war in English.[52][54] Regional BBC workers, based on their regional geo-political climate, would then further censor the material their broadcasts would cover. Nothing was to be added outside the preordained news items.[52][54] For example, the BBC Polish Service was heavily censored due to fears of jeopardising relations with the Soviet Union. Controversial topics, i.e. the contested Polish and Soviet border, the deportation of Polish citizens, the arrests of Polish Home Army members and the Katyn massacre, were not included in Polish broadcasts.[55] American radio broadcasts were broadcast across Europe on BBC channels. This material also passed through the BBC's censorship office, which surveilled and edited American coverage of British affairs.[53] By 1940, across all BBC broadcasts, music by composers from enemy nations was censored. In total, 99 German, 38 Austrian and 38 Italian composers were censored. The BBC argued that like the Italian or German languages, listeners would be irritated by the inclusion of enemy composers.[56] Any potential broadcasters said to have pacifist, communist or fascist ideologies were not allowed on the BBC's airwaves.[57] In 1937, a MI5 security officer was given a permanent office within the organisation. This officer would examine the files of potential political subversives and mark the files of those deemed a security risk to the organisation, blacklisting them. This was often done on spurious grounds; even so, the practice would continue and expand during the years of the Cold War.[58][59]\n",

How are you? Do you remember me, Jasmine Bligh ... ?\"[61] The European Broadcasting Union was formed on 12 February 1950, in Torquay with the BBC among the 23 founding broadcasting organisations.[62]\n",

    "Competition to the BBC was introduced in 1955, with the commercial and independently operated television network of Independent Television (ITV). However, the BBC monopoly on radio services would persist until 8 October 1973 when under the control of the newly renamed Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the UK's first Independent local radio station, LBC came on-air in the London area. As a result of the Pilkington Committee report of 1962, in which the BBC was praised for the quality and range of its output, and ITV was very heavily criticised for not providing enough quality programming,[63] the decision was taken to award the BBC a second television channel, BBC2, in 1964, renaming the existing service BBC1. BBC2 used the higher resolution 625-line standard which had been standardised across Europe. BBC2 was broadcast in colour from 1 July 1967 and was joined by BBC1 and ITV on 15 November 1969. The 405-line VHF transmissions of BBC1 (and ITV) were continued for compatibility with older television receivers until 1985.\n",

In response, the BBC reorganised and renamed their radio channels. On 30 September 1967, the Light Programme was split into Radio 1 offering continuous \"Popular\" music and Radio 2 more \"Easy Listening\".[64] The \"Third\" programme became Radio 3 offering classical music and cultural programming. The Home Service became Radio 4 offering news, and non-musical content such as quiz shows, readings, dramas and plays. As well as the four national channels, a series of local BBC radio stations were established in 1967, including Radio London.[65] In 1969, the BBC Enterprises department was formed to exploit BBC brands and programmes for commercial spin-off products. In 1979, it became a wholly owned limited company, BBC Enterprises Ltd.[66]\n",

    "In 1974, the BBC's teletext service, Ceefax, was introduced, created initially to provide subtitling, but developed into a news and information service. In 1978, BBC staff went on strike just before the Christmas, thus blocking out the transmission of both channels and amalgamating all four radio stations into one.[67][68] Since the deregulation of the UK television and radio market in the 1980s, the BBC has faced increased competition from the commercial sector (and from the advertiser-funded public service broadcaster Channel 4), especially on satellite television, cable television, and digital television services. In the late 1980s, the BBC began a process of divestment by spinning off and selling parts of its organisation. In 1988, it sold off the Hulton Press Library, a photographic archive which had been acquired from the Picture Post magazine by the BBC in 1957. The archive was sold to Brian Deutsch and is now owned by Getty Images.[69] In 1987, the BBC decided to centralize its operations by the management team with the radio and television divisions joining forces together for the first time, the activities of the news and currents departments and coordinated jointly under the new directorate.[70] During the 1990s, this process continued with the separation of certain operational arms of the corporation into autonomous but wholly owned subsidiaries, with the aim of generating additional revenue for programme-making. BBC Enterprises was reorganised and relaunched in 1995, as BBC Worldwide Ltd.[66] In 1998, BBC studios, outside broadcasts, post production, design, costumes and wigs were spun off into BBC Resources Ltd.[71]\n",

The new station would be a news and sport station. In 1997, BBC News 24, a rolling news channel, launched on digital television services, and the following year, BBC Choice was launched as the third general entertainment channel from the BBC. The BBC also purchased The Parliamentary Channel, which was renamed BBC Parliament. In 1999, BBC Knowledge launched as a multimedia channel, with services available on the newly launched BBC Text digital teletext service (later rebranded as BBC Red Button), and on BBC Online.

BBC 1Xtra was a sister station to Radio 1 and specialised in modern black music, BBC 6 Music specialised in alternative music genres and BBC7 specialised in archive, speech and children's programming.[73]\n",

There are long-standing worker shortages in the U.S. healthcare industry, pre-dating the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of COVID-19 vaccine mandates on shortages is ex ante ambiguous. If mandates increase perceived safety of the healthcare industry, marginal workers may be drawn to healthcare, relaxing shortages. On the other hand, if marginal workers are vaccine hesitant or averse, then mandates may push workers away from the industry and exacerbate shortages.',\n",

We combine monthly data from the Current Population Survey 2021 to 2022 with difference-in-differences methods to study the effects of state vaccine mandates on the probability of working in healthcare, and of employment transitions into and out of the industry. Our findings suggest that vaccine mandates may have worsened healthcare workforce shortages: following adoption of a state-level mandate, the probability of working in the healthcare industry declines by 6%. Effects are larger among workers in healthcare-specific occupations, who leave the industry at higher rates in response to mandates and are slower to be replaced than workers in non-healthcare occupations.

Unlike wars that impact economies primarily by destroying physical capital, pan- demics do so predominantly by affecting labor supply and demand, and through general disruptions in supply chains that can distort labor markets and lead to changes in con- sumer demand for goods and services. The emergence of healthcare innovations that effectively reduce the spread of diseases can curtail the adverse impacts of pandemics on economies. Effective vaccines were a major innovation globally in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in the United States, and despite high vaccine effective- ness and government campaigns that included removing financial barriers and informa- tion provision, many Americans opted against vaccination.',\n",
       " ' Effective vaccines were a major innovation globally in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in the United States, and despite high vaccine effective- ness and government campaigns that included removing financial barriers and informa- tion provision, many Americans opted against vaccination. As of September 2021, only 70% of American adults had received the primary vaccine that had been widely available since the spring (Hamel et al.,2021). The non-trivial share of unvaccinated Americans may have reduced the benefits of vaccines to the U.S. To increase vaccination rates, many states adopted COVID-19 vaccine mandates for workers in specific industries, including healthcare, in 2021. The response of the Ameri- can public to these mandates was decidedly mixed. Proponents of the healthcare industry mandate argued that mandates were required to reduce disease contraction in healthcare facilities - patients in these facilities are generally vulnerable to infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and thus require protection, while critics were concerned about negative impacts on the economy, individual rights, vaccine safety, and so forth (Canning et al., 2022).',\n",
       " ' In terms of the response of healthcare workers to the mandates, the impact is ex ante unclear. On the one hand, vaccines may have promoted a safe workplace, drawn workers to the healthcare sector, and reduced ongoing workforce shortages. Alternatively, workers who preferred to remain unvaccinated may have decided to exit, or not enter, the healthcare industry, exacerbating pre-pandemic shortages.Shekhar et al. (2021) and Caiazzo and Stimpfel (2022) provide evidence demonstrating vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, but to date, the impact on employment of healthcare sector workers has not been evaluated, and we are the first to study this question. How healthcare workers respond to vaccine mandates is important for policymakers to understand for future pandemics and for planning the staffing of healthcare facilities. We estimate the impact of state COVID-19 vaccine mandates on employment in the healthcare industry. We draw data from the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS) from January 2021 to December 2022 – the period in which state COVID-19 2 employment vaccine mandates were in place. We match vaccine mandates to the CPS data on state and month, and isolate healthcare workers based on detailed industry information available in the CPS.',\n",

We apply difference-in-differences methods and control for state vaccine mandates in other industries, as these mandates may impact workers’ next-best option if they choose to leave, or not enter, healthcare for another industry. Due to pre-COVID-19 shortages or working under constant pressure since the be- ginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are elevated labor market shortage concerns about some specific types of workers such as healthcare workers in long-term care facil- ities, registered nurses, and mental healthcare providers. To investigate whether state vaccine mandates exacerbated the shortages in these particular industries, we specifically analyze the effect of the mandates on the likelihood of employment in these sectors. In part of the analysis, we separately consider workers in the healthcare industry whose occupations are specific to healthcare and those that are more general.',\n",

In part of the analysis, we separately consider workers in the healthcare industry whose occupations are specific to healthcare and those that are more general. Exit of workers in healthcare-specific occupations may be particularly concerning as these workers are directly involved in patient care and are more likely to have industry-specific skills and to be more difficult to replace if they quit. For example, a dental or medical assistant plausibly requires much more industry-specific training than does a landscaper or cook. Beyond examining ‘level’ effects, that is whether or not a worker is employed in the healthcare sector, we also explore the extent to which healthcare COVID-19 vaccine mandates impact ‘transitions,’ entry and exit by workers to and from the healthcare sector. To estimate transitions, we exploit the panel nature of the CPS and link respon- dents over time, tracking the industries in which they work to observe such transitions.',\n",
       " ' To estimate transitions, we exploit the panel nature of the CPS and link respon- dents over time, tracking the industries in which they work to observe such transitions. Exploring entry and exit allows us to assess whether changes in levels are driven by incumbent workers leaving the industry or potential new workers electing not to enter, behaviors which could have differential impacts on the experience of the healthcare work- force, and potentially quality of care. Thus, we are able to study whether COVID-19 vaccine mandates impact the stock and flow of healthcare industry workers. Our findings suggest that state mandates requiring COVID-19 vaccines among em- ployees reduce the probability of working in the healthcare industry by 6%. The prob- ability declines to a somewhat larger degree among healthcare occupations (7%) than non-healthcare occupations (5%).1 We explore heterogeneity across state policies (e.g., social insurance) and worker demographics (e.g., sex, race, education), and demonstrate broadly similar effects of the mandates across the groups we consider.',\n",

Studying employment transitions in and out of the healthcare industry, we find a large increase in outflows that is not offset by a small increase in inflows. An interpretation of the increased job churning is that quitting workers who are vaccine- averse are partially replaced by new hires who are either pro-vaccine or neutral on the issue. We also find that the increased outflow rate resulting from the mandate is much higher for workers in healthcare-specific occupations than in other occupations.',\n",

We also find that the increased outflow rate resulting from the mandate is much higher for workers in healthcare-specific occupations than in other occupations. Despite this gap in apparent quitting across these two types of occupations, the hiring rates are similar, which may reflect higher costs of replacing the workers with healthcare-specific skills compared to non-healthcare workers. In sum, our results suggest that efforts to in- crease vaccination rates through employment-based mandates in specific industries may have had the unintended consequence of exacerbating the ongoing workforce shortages in many healthcare markets across the U.S. The paper is organized as follows.

In 1855, the state of Massachusetts mandated smallpox vaccinations for chil- dren before going to school to prevent the spread of this disease. Since then, several other states have mandated vaccination against different diseases for school-aged chil- dren, with all states requiring some vaccination for school-entry at the time of writing (National Council of State Legislatures, 2023). In 1902, due to a smallpox outbreak in Massachusetts, the state required a smallpox vaccine for all residents.2 Smallpox vaccine requirements began much earlier in the U.S. Army during the American Revolution- ary War in 1775.',\n",

Since then, different vaccines, including but not limited to influenza, cholera, and hepatitis A, have been administered in the army depending on the type of infectious disease soldiers might be exposed to in each battleground (Grabenstein et al., 2006). In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, arguably the worst pandemic in recorded history which has led to 6.8 million hospitalizations and 1.2 million deaths in the U.S. 2Please see Chervinsky (2021). 4 (COVID Data Tracker, 2024), 3 vaccines with over 85% effectiveness were developed in less than one year after the beginning of the pandemic in 2020.

Governments in the U.S. used mandates for specific groups to increase vaccination rates and reduce the disease burden. Healthcare workers were among the initial groups eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. when the vaccine was released in December 2020. 4 However, due to vaccine hesitancy, which has historical roots dating back to the pre-COVID-19 era (Paterson et al., 2016), a substantial portion of healthcare workers were not comfortable receiving COVID-19 vaccines because of their high perceived risk or low perceived ef- fectiveness of the vaccines (Gagneux-Brunon et al., 2021; Kwok et al., 2021; Gu et al., 2022). One study based on nearly 3,500 healthcare workers from several healthcare sys- tems in five U.S. states over the period October to November 2020 suggests that 8% of respondents did not have any plans to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (Shekhar et al., 2021).

Other studies in the U.S. report hesitancy rates between 8 and 16.4% (Biswas et al., 2021). Immunization is important for healthcare workers for at least two reasons. First, remaining unvaccinated while working in a healthcare facility could increase the risk of patients becoming infected with the virus. Second, working unvaccinated in the healthcare setting could increase the risk of infection among the workers (unvaccinated and vaccinated), which could exacerbate the healthcare worker shortage. COVID-19 vaccine mandates have proven to be an effective policy for increasing vaccine take-up in the general population outside the U.S. Cross-country studies find that these mandates increase vaccination rates in Canada, Germany, France, and Italy (Karaivanov et al.',\n",

COVID-19 vaccine mandates in the U.S. also show a positive impact on the general population’s vaccination rates, with effects appearing as early as three weeks following the mandates’ implementation dates (Howard-Williams et al.,2022; Okpani et al., 2024). McGarry et al. (2022) and Reses et al. (2023) study the effect of these mandates in 15 states using the National Healthcare Safety Network and suggest that these mandates increase the COVID-19 vaccination rate among healthcare workers in nursing home facilities, but with no observed impact on staff shortages. Earlier studies also show that state influenza vaccination requirements for hospital workers 1995-2017 increased the vaccination rate among healthcare workers by 4.2% (Lindley et al.',\n",

The healthcare industry labor shortage is a multifaceted problem including height- ened demand for healthcare services in the baby boomer generation and increases in longevity due to advances in medical care. Based on pre-COVID-19 research in the U.S., healthcare workers’ burnout during COVID-19 pandemic likely exacerbated ongo- ing healthcare worker shortages (Willard-Grace et al.,2019) and increased medical errors (Shanafelt et al., 2010).

A report by the Joint Commission showed that sentinel events7 rose by 20% in 2022 compared to 2021 (The Joint Commission, 2023).8 McGarry et al. (2020) report that 20% of nursing home facilities experienced staffing and protective equipment shortages in the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. However, a survey of facilities in four federal healthcare programs reveals that these facilities were under- staffed prior to the pandemic, with the pandemic exacerbating, rather than originating, this staffing problem (Pandemic Response Accountability Committee,2023).

First, we study the impacts of the policies designed in the wake of the pandemic on the U.S. labor market. A multitude of studies examine the direct impact of the pandemic on economic outcomes, generally suggesting strong and negative effects (Alon et al.,2020; Polyakova et al., 2020; Brodeur et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2021; Montenovo et al., 2022). Other studies have investigated state and federal social-distancing policies (e.g., school closures, shelter-in-place mandates, and mask mandates) adopted during the pandemic prior to development of pharmaceutical interventions when the primary public health response relied on behavioral changes (Courtemanche et al.,2020; Lyu and Wehby, 2020; Abouk and Heydari, 2021), again generally finding that these policies negatively impacted labor markets.',\n",

Our work examines a policy implemented after the height of the pandemic in 2020 and targeting the use of effective vaccines to curb disease spread, and also documents potentially negative impacts on labor markets. Second, we add to the literature on potential distortions of public health policies on labor markets. For example, a long-standing question in labor economics is the extent to which the system of employer-sponsored health insurance leads to ‘job-lock’ in the U.S. labor market (Gruber and Madrian,1994; Garthwaite et al., 2014; Maclean and Webber, 2022), or the extent to which mandating health insurance may reduce employment or wages (Summers, 1989).',\n",

Third, we contribute to the literature that examines factors influencing the size and composition of the healthcare workforce. Studies have examined the impact of reim- bursement, job strain, economic conditions, insurance design, and so forth (Chen et al., 2018;Dillender et al., 2021; Forsythe et al., 2020; Buerhaus et al., 2022; Cantor et al., 2022; Cortes and Forsythe,2023; Barnes et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2024).',\n",

We focus on state actions that compel employees to receive a pharmaceutical intervention that healthcare workers may have reservations against. 9A unique feature of the U.S. labor market is the tight link between employment and insurance. Even after the Affordable Care Act (ACA) created options for health insurance outside employment, the Act also mandated that employers provide insurance, and the vast majority of insured working age adults receive coverage from their employer (Keisler-Stankey et al.,2023). This system creates the potential that employees will remain in jobs they would otherwise leave to retain health insurance coverage.',\n",

First, we use the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS) to construct a sample of individual workers, including those working in healthcare. Second, we utilize policy data on healthcare worker vaccination mandates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Here we describe variable construction and samples from these data sources. 3.1 Current Population Survey We draw data on workers from the monthly CPS between January 2021 and Decem- ber 2022, available through the University of Minnesota’s IPUMS system (Flood et al., 2023). We begin the study period in 2021 as, prior to this year, COVID-19 vaccines were not readily available to the general American public.',\n",

We begin the study period in 2021 as, prior to this year, COVID-19 vaccines were not readily available to the general American public. Indeed, the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first vaccines under emergency use authorization on December 11th, 2020 for most people 16 years and older (Food & Drug Administra- tion, 2021). In 2021 the general population of adults, in large numbers, began to receive the vaccine (Kates et al., 2022). We close the study period in December 2022 as the COVID-19 pandemic wound down and many states repealed their vaccine mandates in late 2022 or soon thereafter (Howard-Williams et al.,2022). The CPS reference week is the week that includes the 12th day of the month (U.S. Census Bureau, 2022). The exception to this rule is December, for which the reference week is the week that includes the 5th day of the month, if that week is fully in December.',\n",

We match mandates to the CPS data based on reference week, that is we require that the reference week proceed the effective date for the mandate. Of the approximately 150,000 observations in each monthly sample, for most of the analysis we retain all civilians aged 21-64 who report being employed at the survey. We use the full civilian population in that age range when we analyze employment and labor force participation in Section4.1.

However, we will use insight from our event-study findings, in particular the dynamics we observe (reported in Section4), to provide suggestive evidence on employer compliance. The CDC data do not include the exact jobs impacted by the mandates, thus we include all employees of healthcare industries in our analysis. A potential limitation of the CDC policy data is that they do not include sub-state (e.g., city or county) vaccine mandates, and thus we do not incorporate this information.

We also observe that workers in mandate adopting states tend to have higher education and are more likely to have been born outside the U.S. than people in non-adopting states.

In Figure 6, where we include as many lags as permitted by our data, mandate effects appear to dis- sipate over time, which aligns with employers gradually hiring to replace vaccine-averse workers who quit in response to the mandate.

Staggered treatment adoption : Recent econometric work suggests that using TWFE regressions with a staggered policy roll-out can lead to bias from heterogeneous treatment effects (Goodman-Bacon, 2021; Borusyak et al., 2021). TWFE regressions can be viewed as an weighted average of all possible two-by-two DID contrasts in the data. In particular, with a staggered policy roll-out and dynamics in treatment effects (e.g., COVID-19 vaccine mandates may increase or decrease over time), some of the comparisons will be reasonable (i.e., comparing units that take treatment to untreated units) while others will be forbidden (i.e., comparing units that take treatment to those that were tread earlier in the study period). These forbidden comparisons may lead to bias in regression coefficients and, in some cases, sign reversals. As shown in Figure 2, there is limited staggering in when states adopt their healthcare mandate.',\n",

These forbidden comparisons may lead to bias in regression coefficients and, in some cases, sign reversals. As shown in Figure 2, there is limited staggering in when states adopt their healthcare mandate. However, some states allow their mandates to expire by the end of our study period (December 2022). Thus, our setting is more complex and our treatment variable is not always an ‘absorbing state.’ This treatment regime creates a comparison in Equation (1) between states that turn off treatment to i) untreated states that do not adopt a mandate by December 2022 and ii) treated states observed during treatment.17 Given that some of the comparisons in our data may lead to bias when using DID with Equation (1), we next use an estimator that can accommodate the non-absorbing and staggered treatment regime that state healthcare worker vaccine mandates follow (de Chaisemartin and d’Haultfoeuille,2020).',\n",

Sample selection : We focus on a sample of employed people in our main analysis as this is the group that is arguably most directly impacted by healthcare worker COVID- 19 vaccine mandates. A possible concern is that the mandates may impact the choice to participate in the labor market and work post-mandate. To examine the importance of such changes, we regress the probability of i) participating in the labor force, ii) employed (vs. not employed and not in the labor force), iii) full-time employment (vs. may also recover a poor estimate of the ATT.

The impact of the mandates potentially differ based on the worker preferences, the extent to which the state policy environment promotes (or perhaps hinders) the ability to obtain a vaccine, and sector of the healthcare market. In this section, we explicitly examine heterogeneity in healthcare worker COVID-19 vaccine mandate effects across state policies, respondent characteristics, and healthcare industry sector. This analysis allows us to shed light on the distributional impacts of the COVID-19 vaccine mandates or, put differently, policy equity. While we do observe some differences in effect sizes across the groups we consider, coefficient estimates are negative in all cases (with the exception of our analysis of specific healthcare sectors) and 95% confidence intervals generally overlap, which prevents us from drawing strong conclusions regarding heterogeneity in mandate effects.',\n",

In Table 4, we explore the importance of two state-level policies that may support workers to become vaccinated post-mandate: paid sick leave (National Partnership for Women & Families,2023) and Medicaid insurance expansions to non-traditional popula- 18 tions that occurred in conjunction with the Affordable Care Act (Kaiser Family Founda- tion, 2023b). Paid sick leave offers financially protected time for healthcare as workers do not have to forego wages to receive care available during normal work hours. Insurance can reduce the out-of-pocket cost of healthcare services, including vaccinations. Indeed, previous economic studies show that both paid sick leave (Pichler and Ziebarth,2017; Pichler et al., 2021; Maclean et al., 2020; Andersen et al.',\n",

The ACA Medicaid expansions largely impacted non-elderly and non-disabled childless adults in terms of those most likely to gain coverage. 21We use the IPUMS harmonized variable METRO (Ruggles et al., 2023). 22We have also used nested models to explore statistical differences.

Post-mandate, the probability decreases by 0.24 ppts (6.9%). 4.4 Healthcare job transitions The effect of vaccine mandates on healthcare industry employment could occur through changes in the rate at which workers exit the industry, enter, or both. Our finding that vaccination mandates lead to decreases in healthcare industry employment imply that exits must increase more than entries. To the extent that both exit and entry increase under the mandate, the higher employee turnover may be associated with exit by those averse to vaccination and entry by those who either find vaccination attractive or at least are not averse to it.',\n",

We construct Exitt and Entert variables from the longitudinal version of the CPS, based on the sample rotation scheme of four months in sample, eight months out, and four more months in, as follows. Exitt is defined for workers in the healthcare industry at time t − 1; this variable equals one if the worker is no longer in the healthcare in- dustry at t (including non-employment), and equals zero if they remain employed in the healthcare industry. Entert is defined for workers in the healthcare industry at time t; this variable equals one if the worker is not in the healthcare industry at t − 1 (including non-employed), and equals zero if they remain employed in the healthcare industry.',\n",

For healthcare occupations we include only healthcare industry workers in healthcare occupations (HCO =1) at time t−1 for exit, and t for entry, respectively. The procedure is analogous for non-healthcare occupations. Table A4 shows summary statistics for the exit and entry samples by mandate states and non-mandate states, separately. In the mandate states before the mandates and in non-mandate states, about 5.0% of workers exit and enter the healthcare industry each month. The transition rates are slightly higher in mandate states during the pre-mandate period than non-mandate states. The transition rate is higher among non-healthcare than healthcare occupation workers, consistent with more industry-specific skills for the latter than the former. 27 Respondent characteristics are well-balanced except for other races, Hispanics, and those born outside the U.S., where mandate states have higher shares than non-mandate states.',\n",

Starting with the top panel, for exit, in all four specifications the mandate is estimated to raise the exit rate from the healthcare indus- try by close to one ppt.

The coefficient of 0.014 implies an approximate 30% increase in the exit rate.',\n",

The impact on exit of workers in non-healthcare occupations is negligible, implying the workers in non-healthcare occupations do not react negatively to the mandate. Moreover, turning to the bottom panel with results for entry, the vaccine mandate is estimated to have a much lower impact on hiring in healthcare occupations than either the exit rate among those occupations or compared to entry into non-healthcare occupations. Consistent with the results in Table 5, these findings suggest that the vaccine mandate may have resulted in a relative fall in healthcare occupations, implying a substitution of workers in non-healthcare for those in healthcare occupations. 5 Robustness and extensions In this section, we explore the robustness of our main findings to alternative specifica- tions and samples. For brevity, we focus on the probability of working in the healthcare industry. We display results graphically in Figure A2. We report the main estimated effect from Table 2, Column (3) on the left.

After that, we tailor the analytical sample by excluding the data from the last quarter of 2022, drop 2022 (when a federal mandate for select healthcare work- ers was in place), dropping observations for states that removed the mandate during our study period (January 2021 to December 2022) after the expiration date, and dropping divisions that include no state that adopted a mandate, and using the event-study sam- ple (i.e, we trim the data in event time, dropping observations for treated states more than eight months before or after mandate adoption).

First, the event-study for the probability of healthcare industry employment (Figure 5) shows that the impact of the mandate increases for two months, reaching a maximum magnitude at two months after the effective date and becomes slightly weaker thereafter, a pattern that might be explained by quick resignations of vaccine-averse employees and slow replacement hiring. Also, the situation changed at the federal level, as the Department of Health and Human Services required full vaccination in facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid by January 2022. The effectiveness of this rule is unclear, but it could have reduced the impact in 2022 relative to 2021. 29 We also conduct a ‘leave-one-out’ analysis in which we sequentially exclude each state that adopts a COVID-19 vaccine mandate and re-estimate Equation 1.',\n",

To provide some exploratory evidence on such impacts, we investigate whether there are changes in mortality among adults 65 years and older post- mandate. We select older adult mortality to proxy healthcare quality following previous work (Sloan et al., 2001; Picone et al., 2002; Amiri and Solankallio-Vahteri,2019; Lasater et al., 2021).30 The rationale for choosing this metric is that older adults are a vulnerable 29Enforcement of the federal requirements was postponed by a lawsuit of 26 states, until the Supreme Court narrowly voted in favor of the requirements in March 2022. 30In unreported analyses, available on request, we have examined the impact of these mandates on measures of healthcare shortages, the primary channel through which we expect the mandates to impact health, using data from Kaiser Family Foundation (2023a).',\n",

Analyses suggested that both metrics worsened in states that adopted COVID-19 healthcare industry mandates, but the relationship was only statistically distinguishable from 23 population and their health, including mortality, is likely more responsive to changes in healthcare quality than younger adults.

The magnitude of the decline in healthcare worker employment due to vaccine mandates is comparable to the magnitude of the decline in employment in the healthcare industry during the first few months of the pandemic, beginning in March 2020, before experiencing a gain in employment rebounding to the pre-COVID- 19 employment levels (Cantor et al.,2022; Buerhaus et al., 2022; Forsythe et al., 2020; Cortes and Forsythe, 2023; Shen et al., 2024).

First, we lack data on mandate enforcement by employ- ers, preventing us from exploring this margin of the mandates. Second, we have no information on the effect of healthcare worker vaccine mandates on healthcare workers’ COVID-19 vaccination rates. This limitation is due to the unavailability of the vaccina- tion statistics for this particular group at the national level (see Section2). Although interesting, we argue that reporting these results is not essential for our analysis as we investigate how these mandates affect willingness to work in the healthcare industry. Furthermore, compelling evidence of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers makes our results plausible. Finally, we lack data on compliance costs to firms, which may be important.

Our findings suggest that although vaccine mandates have shown to be successful in increasing vaccine uptake in non-U.S. settings, they appear to exacerbate on-going labor shortages in the healthcare industry. Therefore, to be able to benefit from the public health impact of these mandates, without harming the healthcare workforce, policymak- ers could consider combining mandates with other interventions that promote vaccination such as direct financial incentives; providing vaccines at the worksite and without costs; and education campaigns designed to increase information (and decrease dis-information) about vaccines in terms of effectiveness, positive externalities, and safety. Another pos- sible approach - if elevating vaccination rates among healthcare workers comes at too high a cost in terms of workforce shortages - is to focus such efforts on other groups, for example patients in healthcare facilities and their family members, and society more broadly defined.',\n",

In sum, future waves of COVID-19 and other viruses are likely to emerge and there could be another pandemic, and thus learning from the most recent experience could help develop policies for future events. 26 References Abouk, R. and Heydari, B.

       "'The BBC was established under a royal charter,[8] and operates under an agreement with the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.[9] Its work is funded principally by an annual television licence fee[10] which is charged to all British households, companies, and organisations using any type of equipment to receive or record live television broadcasts or to use the BBC\\'s streaming service, iPlayer.[11] The fee is set by the British Government, agreed by Parliament,[12] and is used to fund the BBC\\'s radio, TV, and online services covering the nations and regions of the UK. Since 1 April 2014, it has also funded the BBC World Service (launched in 1932 as the BBC Empire Service), which broadcasts in 28 languages and provides comprehensive TV, radio, and online services in Arabic and Persian. Some of the BBC\\'s revenue comes from its commercial subsidiary BBC Studios (formerly BBC Worldwide), which sells BBC programmes and services internationally and also distributes the BBC\\'s international 24-hour English-language news services BBC News, and from BBC.com, provided by BBC Global News Ltd.[13][14] In 2009, the company was awarded the Queen\\'s Award for Enterprise in recognition of its international achievements in business.[15] Since its formation in 1922, the BBC has played a prominent role in British life and culture.[16] It is sometimes informally referred to as the Beeb or Auntie.[17][18] In 1923 it launched Radio Times (subtitled \"The official organ of the BBC\"), the first broadcast listings magazine; the 1988 Christmas edition sold 11 million copies, the biggest-selling edition of any British magazine in history.[19] History For a chronological guide, see Timeline of the BBC. The birth of British broadcasting, 1920 to 1922 Britain\\'s first live public broadcast was made from the factory of Marconi Company in Chelmsford in June 1920. It was sponsored by the Daily Mail\\'s Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe and featured the famous Australian soprano Dame Nellie Melba. The Melba broadcast caught the people\\'s imagination and marked a turning point in the British public\\'s attitude to radio.[20]:\\u200a47\\u200a However, this public enthusiasm was not shared in official circles where such broadcasts were held to interfere with important military and civil communications. By late 1920, the pressure from these quarters and uneasiness among the staff of the licensing authority, the General Post Office (GPO), was sufficient to lead to a ban on further Chelmsford broadcasts.[20]:\\u200a50\\u200a But by 1922, the GPO had received nearly 100 broadcast licence requests[21]:\\u200a110\\u200a and moved to rescind its ban in the wake of a petition by 63 wireless societies with over 3,000 members.[20]:\\u200a50–97\\u200a Anxious to avoid the same chaotic expansion experienced in the United States, the GPO proposed that it would issue a single broadcasting licence to a company jointly owned by a consortium of leading wireless receiver manufacturers, to be known as the British Broadcasting Company Ltd, which was formed on 18 October 1922.[22] John Reith, a Scottish Calvinist, was appointed its general manager in December 1922 a few weeks after the company made its first official broadcast.[21]:\\u200a110\\u200a L. Stanton Jefferies was its first director of music.[23] The company was to be financed by a royalty on the sale of BBC wireless receiving sets from approved domestic manufacturers.[24] To this day, the BBC aims to follow the Reithian directive to \"inform, educate and entertain\".[25] From private company towards public service corporation, 1923 to 1926 The first issue of the Radio Times (28 September 1923) The financial arrangements soon proved inadequate. Set sales were disappointing as amateurs made their own receivers and listeners bought rival unlicensed sets.[20]:\\u200a146\\u200a By mid-1923, discussions between the GPO and the BBC had become deadlocked and the Postmaster General commissioned a review of broadcasting by the Sykes Committee.[26] The committee recommended a short-term reorganisation of licence fees with improved enforcement in order to address the BBC\\'s immediate financial distress, and an increased share of the licence revenue split between it and the GPO. This was to be followed by a simple 10 shillings licence fee to fund broadcasts.[26] The BBC\\'s broadcasting monopoly was made explicit for the duration of its current broadcast licence, as was the prohibition on advertising. To avoid competition with newspapers, Fleet Street persuaded the government to ban news bulletins before 7 pm and the BBC was required to source all news from external wire services.[26] The Radio Times, the world\\'s first and longest-running radio and television listings magazine, was launched by Reith in September 1923.[19] The first edition, subtitled \"The official organ of the BBC\", was priced at tuppence (two pence) on newsstands, and quickly sold out its run of a quarter of a million copies.[27] Mid-1925 found the future of broadcasting under further consideration, this time by the Crawford committee. By now, the BBC, under Reith\\'s leadership, had forged a consensus favouring a continuation of the unified (monopoly) broadcasting service, but more money was still required to finance rapid expansion. Wireless manufacturers were anxious to exit the loss-making consortium, and Reith was keen that the BBC be seen as a public service rather than a commercial enterprise. The recommendations of the Crawford Committee were published in March the following year and were still under consideration by the GPO when the 1926 United Kingdom general strike broke out in May. The strike temporarily interrupted newspaper production, and with restrictions on news bulletins waived, the BBC suddenly became the primary source of news for the duration of the crisis.[21]:\\u200a117\\u200a The crisis placed the BBC in a delicate position. On the one hand Reith was acutely aware that the government might exercise its right to commandeer the BBC at any time as a mouthpiece of the government if the BBC were to step out of line, but on the other he was anxious to maintain public trust by appearing to be acting independently. The government was divided on how to handle the BBC, but ended up trusting Reith, whose opposition to the strike mirrored the PM\\'s own. Although Winston Churchill in particular wanted to commandeer the BBC to use it \"to the best possible advantage\", Reith wrote that Stanley Baldwin\\'s government wanted to be able to say \"that they did not commandeer [the BBC], but they know that they can trust us not to be really impartial\".[28] Thus the BBC was granted sufficient leeway to pursue the government\\'s objectives largely in a manner of its own choosing. Supporters of the strike nicknamed the BBC the BFC for British Falsehood Company. Reith personally announced the end of the strike which he marked by reciting from Blake\\'s \"Jerusalem\" signifying that England had been saved.[29] While the BBC tends to characterise its coverage of the general strike by emphasising the positive impression created by its balanced coverage of the views of government and strikers, Seaton has characterised the episode as the invention of \"modern propaganda in its British form\".[21]:\\u200a117\\u200a Reith argued that trust gained by \\'authentic impartial news\\' could then be used. Impartial news was not necessarily an end in itself.[21]:\\u200a118\\u200a The BBC did well out of the crisis, which cemented a national audience for its broadcasting, and it was followed by the Government\\'s acceptance of the recommendation made by the Crawford Committee (1925–26) that the British Broadcasting Company be replaced by a non-commercial, Crown-chartered organisation: the British Broadcasting Corporation.[26] 1927 to 1939 The Radio Times masthead from 25 December 1931, including the BBC motto \"Nation shall speak peace unto Nation\" Television pioneer John Logie Baird (seen here in 1917) televised the BBC\\'s first drama, The Man with the Flower in His Mouth, on 14 July 1930, and the first live outside broadcast, The Derby, on 2 June 1931.[30][31] The British Broadcasting Corporation came into existence on 1 January 1927, and Reith – newly knighted – was appointed its first director general. To represent its purpose and (stated) values, the new corporation adopted the coat of arms, including the motto \"Nation shall speak peace unto Nation\".[32] British radio audiences had little choice apart from the upscale programming of the BBC. Reith, an intensely moralistic executive, was in full charge. His goal was to broadcast \"All that is best in every department of human knowledge, endeavour and achievement.... The preservation of a high moral tone is obviously of paramount importance.\"[33] Reith succeeded in building a high wall against an American-style free-for-all in radio in which the goal was to attract the largest audiences and thereby secure the greatest advertising revenue. There was no paid advertising on the BBC; all the revenue came from a tax on receiving sets. Highbrow audiences, however, greatly enjoyed it.[34] At a time when American, Australian and Canadian stations were drawing huge audiences cheering for their local teams with the broadcast of baseball, rugby and hockey, the BBC emphasised service for a national rather than a regional audience. Boat races were well covered along with tennis and horse racing, but the BBC was reluctant to spend its severely limited air time on long football or cricket games, regardless of their popularity.[35] The BBC\\'s radio studio in Birmingham, from the BBC Hand Book 1928, which described it as \"Europe\\'s largest studio\" John Reith and the BBC, with support from the Crown, determined the universal needs of the people of Britain and broadcast content according to these perceived standards.[36] Reith effectively censored anything that he felt would be harmful, directly or indirectly.[37] While recounting his time with the BBC in 1935, Raymond Postgate claims that BBC broadcasters were made to submit a draft of their potential broadcast for approval. It was expected that they tailored their content to accommodate the modest, church-going elderly or a member of the Clergy.[38] Until 1928, entertainers broadcasting on the BBC, both singers and \"talkers\" were expected to avoid biblical quotations, Clerical impersonations and references, references to drink or Prohibition in the United States, vulgar and doubtful matter and political allusions.[37] The BBC excluded popular foreign music and musicians from its broadcasts, while promoting British alternatives.[39] On 5 March 1928, Stanley Baldwin, the Prime Minister, maintained the censorship of editorial opinions on public policy, but allowed the BBC to address matters of religious, political or industrial controversy.[40] The resulting political \"talk series\", designed to inform England on political issues, were criticised by members of parliament, including Winston Churchill, David Lloyd George and Sir Austen Chamberlain. Those who opposed these chats claimed that they silence the opinions of those in Parliament who are not nominated by Party Leaders or Party Whips, thus stifling independent, non-official views.[40] In October 1932, the policemen of the Metropolitan Police Federation marched in protest at a proposed pay cut. Fearing dissent within the police force and public support for the movement, the BBC censored its coverage of the events, only broadcasting official statements from the government.[40] Throughout the 1930s, political broadcasts had been closely monitored by the BBC.[41] In 1935, the BBC censored the broadcasts of Oswald Mosley and Harry Pollitt.[40] Mosley was a leader of the British Union of Fascists, and Pollitt a leader of the Communist Party of Great Britain. They had been contracted to provide a series of five broadcasts on their parties\\' politics. The BBC, in conjunction with The Foreign Office of Britain, first suspended this series and ultimately cancelled it without the notice of the public.[41][40] Less radical politicians faced similar censorship. In 1938, Winston Churchill proposed a series of talks regarding British domestic and foreign politics and affairs but was similarly censored.[41] The censorship of political discourse by the BBC was a precursor to the total shutdown of political debate that manifested over the BBC\\'s wartime airwaves.[41] The Foreign Office maintained that the public should not be aware of their role in the censorship.[40] From 1935 to 1939, the BBC also attempted to unite the British Empire\\'s radio waves, sending staff to Egypt, Palestine, Newfoundland, Jamaica, India, Canada and South Africa.[42] Reith personally visited South Africa, lobbying for state-run radio programmes which was accepted by South African Parliament in 1936.[42] A similar programme was adopted in Canada. Through collaboration with these state-run broadcasting centres, Reith left a legacy of cultural influence across the empire of Great Britain with his departure from the corporation in 1938.[42] Experimental television broadcasts were started in 1929, using an electromechanical 30-line system developed by John Logie Baird.[43] Limited regular broadcasts using this system began in 1932, and an expanded service (now named the BBC Television Service) started from Alexandra Palace in November 1936, alternating between an improved Baird mechanical 240-line system and the all-electronic 405-line Marconi-EMI system which had been developed by an EMI research team led by Sir Isaac Shoenberg.[44] The superiority of the electronic system saw the mechanical system dropped early the following year, with the Marconi-EMI system the first fully electronic television system in the world to be used in regular broadcasting.[45] BBC versus other media King George V giving the 1934 Royal Christmas message on BBC Radio. The annual message typically reflects on the year\\'s major events. The success of broadcasting provoked animosities between the BBC and well-established media such as theatres, concert halls and the recording industry. By 1929, the BBC complained that the agents of many comedians refused to sign contracts for broadcasting, because they feared it harmed the artist \"by making his material stale\" and that it \"reduces the value of the artist as a visible music-hall performer\". On the other hand, the BBC was \"keenly interested\" in a cooperation with the recording companies who \"in recent years ... have not been slow to make records of singers, orchestras, dance bands, etc. who have already proved their power to achieve popularity by wireless.\" Radio plays were so popular that the BBC had received 6,000 manuscripts by 1929, most of them written for stage and of little value for broadcasting: \"Day in and day out, manuscripts come in, and nearly all go out again through the post, with a note saying \\'We regret, etc.\\'\"[46] In the 1930s music broadcasts also enjoyed great popularity, for example the friendly and wide-ranging BBC Theatre Organ broadcasts at St George\\'s Hall, London by Reginald Foort, who held the official role of BBC Staff Theatre Organist from 1936 to 1938.[47] Second World War Statue of George Orwell outside Broadcasting House, headquarters of the BBC Television broadcasting was suspended from 1 September 1939 to 7 June 1946, during the World War II, and it was left to BBC Radio broadcasters such as Reginald Foort to keep the nation\\'s spirits up. The BBC moved most of its radio operations out of London, initially to Bristol, and then to Bedford. Concerts were broadcast from the Bedford Corn Exchange; the Trinity Chapel in St Paul\\'s Church, Bedford was the studio for the daily service from 1941 to 1945, and, in the darkest days of the war in 1941, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York came to St Paul\\'s to broadcast to the UK and the world on the National Day of Prayer. BBC employees during the war included George Orwell who spent two years with the broadcaster.[48] During his role as prime minister during the war, Winston Churchill delivered 33 major wartime speeches by radio, all of which were carried by the BBC within the UK.[49] On 18 June 1940, French general Charles de Gaulle, in exile in London as the leader of the Free French, made a speech, broadcast by the BBC, urging the French people not to capitulate to the Nazis.[50] In October 1940, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret made their first radio broadcast for the BBC\\'s Children\\'s Hour, addressing other children who had been evacuated from cities.[51] In 1938, John Reith and the Government of the United Kingdom, specifically the Ministry of Information which had been set up for WWII, designed a censorship apparatus for the inevitability of war.[52] Due to the BBC\\'s advancements in shortwave radio technology, the corporation could broadcast across the world during the Second World War.[53] Within Europe, the BBC European Service would gather intelligence and information regarding the current events of the war in English.[52][54] Regional BBC workers, based on their regional geo-political climate, would then further censor the material their broadcasts would cover. Nothing was to be added outside the preordained news items.[52][54] For example, the BBC Polish Service was heavily censored due to fears of jeopardising relations with the Soviet Union. Controversial topics, i.e. the contested Polish and Soviet border, the deportation of Polish citizens, the arrests of Polish Home Army members and the Katyn massacre, were not included in Polish broadcasts.[55] American radio broadcasts were broadcast across Europe on BBC channels. This material also passed through the BBC\\'s censorship office, which surveilled and edited American coverage of British affairs.[53] By 1940, across all BBC broadcasts, music by composers from enemy nations was censored. In total, 99 German, 38 Austrian and 38 Italian composers were censored. The BBC argued that like the Italian or German languages, listeners would be irritated by the inclusion of enemy composers.[56] Any potential broadcasters said to have pacifist, communist or fascist ideologies were not allowed on the BBC\\'s airwaves.[57] In 1937, a MI5 security officer was given a permanent office within the organisation. This officer would examine the files of potential political subversives and mark the files of those deemed a security risk to the organisation, blacklisting them. This was often done on spurious grounds; even so, the practice would continue and expand during the years of the Cold War.[58][59] Later 20th century Produced between 1934 and 1959, the BBC-Marconi Type A microphone has been described as an iconic symbol of the BBC alongside the channel\\'s most famous emblem, the rotating globe, which was introduced in 1963.[60] There was a widely reported urban myth that, upon resumption of the BBC television service after the war, announcer Leslie Mitchell started by saying, \"As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted ...\" In fact, the first person to appear when transmission resumed was Jasmine Bligh and the words said were \"Good afternoon, everybody. How are you? Do you remember me, Jasmine Bligh ... ?\"[61] The European Broadcasting Union was formed on 12 February 1950, in Torquay with the BBC among the 23 founding broadcasting organisations.[62] Competition to the BBC was introduced in 1955, with the commercial and independently operated television network of Independent Television (ITV). However, the BBC monopoly on radio services would persist until 8 October 1973 when under the control of the newly renamed Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the UK\\'s first Independent local radio station, LBC came on-air in the London area. As a result of the Pilkington Committee report of 1962, in which the BBC was praised for the quality and range of its output, and ITV was very heavily criticised for not providing enough quality programming,[63] the decision was taken to award the BBC a second television channel, BBC2, in 1964, renaming the existing service BBC1. BBC2 used the higher resolution 625-line standard which had been standardised across Europe. BBC2 was broadcast in colour from 1 July 1967 and was joined by BBC1 and ITV on 15 November 1969. The 405-line VHF transmissions of BBC1 (and ITV) were continued for compatibility with older television receivers until 1985. Television Centre at White City, west London, which opened in 1960 and closed in 2013 Starting in 1964, a series of pirate radio stations (starting with Radio Caroline) came on the air and forced the British government finally to regulate radio services to permit nationally based advertising-financed services. In response, the BBC reorganised and renamed their radio channels. On 30 September 1967, the Light Programme was split into Radio 1 offering continuous \"Popular\" music and Radio 2 more \"Easy Listening\".[64] The \"Third\" programme became Radio 3 offering classical music and cultural programming. The Home Service became Radio 4 offering news, and non-musical content such as quiz shows, readings, dramas and plays. As well as the four national channels, a series of local BBC radio stations were established in 1967, including Radio London.[65] In 1969, the BBC Enterprises department was formed to exploit BBC brands and programmes for commercial spin-off products. In 1979, it became a wholly owned limited company, BBC Enterprises Ltd.[66] In 1974, the BBC\\'s teletext service, Ceefax, was introduced, created initially to provide subtitling, but developed into a news and information service. In 1978, BBC staff went on strike just before the Christmas, thus blocking out the transmission of both channels and amalgamating all four radio stations into one.[67][68] Since the deregulation of the UK television and radio market in the 1980s, the BBC has faced increased competition from the commercial sector (and from the advertiser-funded public service broadcaster Channel 4), especially on satellite television, cable television, and digital television services. In the late 1980s, the BBC began a process of divestment by spinning off and selling parts of its organisation. In 1988, it sold off the Hulton Press Library, a photographic archive which had been acquired from the Picture Post magazine by the BBC in 1957. The archive was sold to Brian Deutsch and is now owned by Getty Images.[69] In 1987, the BBC decided to centralize its operations by the management team with the radio and television divisions joining forces together for the first time, the activities of the news and currents departments and coordinated jointly under the new directorate.[70] During the 1990s, this process continued with the separation of certain operational arms of the corporation into autonomous but wholly owned subsidiaries, with the aim of generating additional revenue for programme-making. BBC Enterprises was reorganised and relaunched in 1995, as BBC Worldwide Ltd.[66] In 1998, BBC studios, outside broadcasts, post production, design, costumes and wigs were spun off into BBC Resources Ltd.[71] The BBC Research & Development has played a major part in the development of broadcasting and recording techniques. The BBC was also responsible for the development of the NICAM stereo standard. In recent decades, a number of additional channels and radio stations have been launched: Radio 5 was launched in 1990, as a sports and educational station, but was replaced in 1994, with BBC Radio 5 Live to become a live radio station, following the success of the Radio 4 service to cover the 1991 Gulf War. The new station would be a news and sport station. In 1997, BBC News 24, a rolling news channel, launched on digital television services, and the following year, BBC Choice was launched as the third general entertainment channel from the BBC. The BBC also purchased The Parliamentary Channel, which was renamed BBC Parliament. In 1999, BBC Knowledge launched as a multimedia channel, with services available on the newly launched BBC Text digital teletext service (later rebranded as BBC Red Button), and on BBC Online. The channel had an educational aim, which was modified later on in its life to offer documentaries. 2000 to 2011 In 2002, several television and radio channels were reorganised. BBC Knowledge was replaced by BBC Four and became the BBC\\'s arts and documentaries channel. CBBC, which had been a programming strand as Children\\'s BBC since 1985, was split into CBBC and CBeebies, for younger children, with both new services getting a digital channel: the CBBC Channel and CBeebies Channel.[72] In addition to the television channels, new digital radio stations were created: 1Xtra, 6 Music and Radio 4 Extra. BBC 1Xtra was a sister station to Radio 1 and specialised in modern black music, BBC 6 Music specialised in alternative music genres and BBC7 specialised in archive, speech and children\\'s programming.[73] England fans in Manchester during a 2006 FIFA World Cup game shown on the BBC Big Screen The following few years resulted in repositioning of some channels to conform to a larger brand: in 2003, BBC Choice was replaced by BBC Three, with programming for younger adults and shocking real-life documentaries, BBC News 24 became the BBC News Channel in 2008, and BBC Radio 7 became BBC Radio 4 Extra in 2011, with new programmes to supplement those broadcast on Radio 4. In 2008, another channel was launched, BBC Alba, a Scottish Gaelic service. During this decade, the corporation began to sell off a number of its operational divisions to private owners; BBC Broadcast was spun off as a separate company in 2002,[74] and in 2005, it was sold off to Australian-based Macquarie Capital Alliance Group and Macquarie Group Limited and rebranded Red Bee Media.[75] The BBC\\'s IT, telephony and broadcast technology were brought together as BBC Technology Ltd in 2001,[74] and the division was later sold to the German company Siemens IT Solutions and Services (SIS).[76] SIS was subsequently acquired from Siemens by the French company Atos.[77] Further divestments included BBC Books (sold to Random House in 2006);[78] BBC Outside Broadcasts Ltd (sold in 2008 to Satellite Information Services);[79] Costumes and Wigs (stock sold in 2008 to Angels Costumes);[80] and BBC Magazines (sold to Immediate Media Company in 2011).[81] After the sales of OBs and costumes, the remainder of BBC Resources was reorganised as BBC Studios and Post Production, which continues today as a wholly owned subsidiary of the BBC. The 2004 Hutton Inquiry and the subsequent report raised questions about the BBC\\'s journalistic standards and its impartiality. This led to resignations of senior management members at the time including the then Director General, Greg Dyke. In January 2007, the BBC released minutes of the board meeting which led to Greg Dyke\\'s resignation.[82] Unlike the other departments of the BBC, the BBC World Service was funded by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, more commonly known as the Foreign Office or the FCO, is the British government department responsible for promoting the interests of the United Kingdom abroad. BBC Pacific Quay in Glasgow, which was opened in 2007 A strike in 2005 by more than 11,000 BBC workers, over a proposal to cut 4,000 jobs, and to privatise parts of the BBC, disrupted much of the BBC\\'s regular programming.[83][84] In 2006, BBC HD launched as an experimental service and became official in December 2007. The channel broadcast HD simulcasts of programmes on BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Three and BBC Four as well as repeats of some older programmes in HD. In 2010, an HD simulcast of BBC One launched: BBC One HD. The channel uses HD versions of BBC One\\'s schedule and uses upscaled versions of programmes not currently produced in HD. The BBC HD channel closed in March 2013 and was replaced by BBC Two HD in the same month.\\' '"
