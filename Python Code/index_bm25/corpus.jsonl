{"id": 2, "text": "which is based on local community workers The slum residents are an important population to consider They were typically migrants from rural areas with limited local support networks and are extremely poor However, as baseline data confirmed, they had high aspirations for their children We can thus expect them to be open to interventions to improve human development for their 1 children, which might increase their motivation to engage with the program Our focus is on ECD because it is well established that deficits in child development, once they have set in, are hard to reverse and thus play a key role in the intergenerational transmission of poverty Millions of children around the world are at risk of not achieving their potential because of their exposure to poverty and deprivation, making it a major social and public health problem (Bhutta et al , 2022) Hence, successful early interventions in childhood have the potential of becoming central elements of policies promoting development and fighting poverty More specifically, disadvantage in the first three years of life affects the development of children’s brain and endocrine system (Jensen et al , 2021) Delays in development, which become apparent from the first year, are associated with poor school achievement and adult functioning, contributing to the intergenerational transmission of poverty While these issues are relevant wherever poverty is present, they are particularly salient in LMICs (Black et al (2016) Hamadani et al (2014)) The consequences of the early delays in development have therefore important consequences for individual well-being over the life cycle and, more generally, for economic development To provide solutions to this problem we implemented an adaptation of the homevisiting program Reach-Up, a parenting intervention originally developed for the Jamaica study, which focuses on caregiver-child interactions and on the home environment 1 In most societies, very young children spend far more time with their mother at home, than with anyone else For this reason, children’s home environment – which we take to include both caregiver-child interactions and the material environment, such as access to play materials – is paramount in shaping children’s development during these earliest years (Attanasio et al , 2020a, 2022) However, poverty, beyond limiting material resources that can be used for child learning and stimulation, can also cause stress and anxiety for parents, making it hard 1See https //reachupandlearn com/ 2 for them to prioritize creating a stimulating and nurturing environment (Engle and Black, 2008) Very low levels of education may also limit parents’ understanding of age-appropriate parenting and its role in the process of child development For mothers living in poverty in India, all of these challenges are likely to be exacerbated by a high degree of social isolation limiting the support they can draw on (Kandpal and Baylis, 2019 Andrew et al , 2023), by highly unequal gendered distribution of power and resources (Calvi, 2020) and by the fact that many women become mothers for the first time at a young age Over the short-term, many programs have been found to be effective at improving the quality of adult-child interaction, increasing parents’"}
{"id": 3, "text": "programs have been found to be effective at improving the quality of adult-child interaction, increasing parents’ investments and improving child development (see, for instance, Attanasio et al (2022)) However, there is little – and mixed – evidence on whether such impacts are sustained over the longer-term 2 Both in LMICs and higher income countries, in the few studies that have been followed up over the long-term (Jeong et al , 2021b), it has often been observed that measured impacts fade out partially or completely in the medium-term only to reappear in adult outcomes later on (see Bailey et al (2017) for an example in high-income countries) This pattern is observed in the Jamaica experiment cited above, as well as in other well-conducted trials, such as those described in Heckman et al (2013) and Elango et al (2016) This evidence suggests that following up with children who participated in such studies over a substantial part of their life-cycle is key for a deeper understanding of how early interventions can benefit people and how sustainable there impacts are Understanding whether impacts persist is crucial for determining whether particular interventions can make a significant difference to the opportunities of underprivileged children On the one hand, there is evidence that the process of child development is such that later investments are complements with the stock of accumulated human capital, which would suggest the possibility of sustained and lasting impacts (as pointed out, for instance 2For example, in an ECD intervention in Colombia (Attanasio et al , 2014) showed substantial impacts on child development and parental investments at endline However, Andrew et al (2018) found that these impacts had disappeared after two years 3 by Heckman et al (2013) Garcia et al (2021) Attanasio et al (2020b)) On the other hand, it is possible that the short-term impacts are influenced by factors that may not be permanent For instance, if an intervention exposes children to the types of tasks that are subsequently used to measure their development, certain measured impacts could be reflecting “teaching to the test” and be only of short-run duration (see Heckman et al , 2020) Moreover, parental behavioral changes, which seem key to mediating the effects of interventions (Attanasio et al , 2020a), may not be sustained or may no longer be age appropriate as children grow Evidence that early years interventions have long-lasting effects is more abundant in high income countries (see for example Campbell et al (2014) Heckman et al (2010) Doyle (2020)), but much less so in developing countries, where the most important follow up is from Jamaica (Gertler et al , 2014) There are good reasons to believe that long-term sustainability of impacts may be very different in environments with fundamentally different institutions, such as quality of schools and welfare programs and also very different initial conditions Hence, our paper helps to fill an important gap in this literature by considering the medium term impacts of a scalable intervention among some of the most deprived people in India, a low income country setting The target of the intervention we"}

{"id": 14, "text": "stunting status, the children of less educated mothers did catch up 5 Discussion and Conclusions The medium-term impacts of the intervention demonstrate a remarkable persistence of the benefits four and a half years after the intervention ended The initial trial was randomized, the retrieval rates of participants was reasonable with a balanced loss and testers who were blind to the children’s group assignment These results are important for several reasons First, very limited evidence exists on the medium- term effects of child development interventions from LMICs Second, governments in LMICs are particularly concerned about poor literacy and numeracy levels even when children are enrolled in school Evidence from six longitudinal studies in the US found that preschool math and reading ability on school enrollment are the strongest predictors of later school reading and math achievement, suggesting that the participants may continue to show improved school achievement, with subsequent better life chances (Duncan et al , 2007) The precise mechanism whereby benefits are sustained is unknown, but the size of the effect at the immediate end of the intervention and the quality of the subsequent environment 19 may play a role The improvement in the home environment and the extra money parents spent on education suggest that the parents were also affected and provided more nurturing homes and better education which may be part of the mechanism And returning to the original motivation for ECD, the improved nurturing may have permanent neurological effects on the brain (Jensen et al , 2021) The results are also important because there can be no suggestion that the benefits were taught as part of the intervention The children were too young at the end of intervention (28 to 38 months old) to be taught literacy and numeracy, on which we report sizable impacts Therefore, the intervention must have improved their ability to learn new skills and knowledge, which could be an example of dynamic complementarities, in which skills beget skills, suggested as a mechanism to explain late onset benefits Finally, all this was achieved with minimal resources based on locally available women, without any specific qualifications, trained for this intervention just for a few weeks This demonstrates the potential for policy to dramatically improve child outcomes without insuperable scaling-up constraints 20 References Aboud, F and Yousafzai, A (2015) Global health and development in early childhood Annual Review of Psychology 66 433–57 Andrew, A , Attanasio, O , Augsburg, B , Behrman, J , Day, M , Jervis, P , Meghir, C , and Phimister, A (2023) Mothers’ social networks and socioeconomic gradients of isolation Economic Development and Cultural Change Andrew, A , Attanasio, O , Augsburg, B , Day, M , Grantham-McGregor, S , Meghir, C , Mehrin, F , Pahwa, S , and Rubio-Codina, M (2019) Effects of a scalable home-visiting intervention on child development in slums of urban India Evidence from a randomised controlled trial Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry Andrew, A , Attanasio, O , Fitzsimons, E , Grantham-McGregor, S , Meghir, C , and RubioCodina, M (2018) Impacts 2 years after a"}

{"id": 22, "text": "in providing health care in these areas, mainly due to chronic provider shortages and high fixed costs of providing hospital care in rural areas (Alexander Richards, 2021 Wishner et al , 2016 Gong et al 2019) Thus, it is imperative for policymakers to understand the effects of ED closures on health outcomes when considering the consequences of hospital consolidation and closures in rural communities In this paper, we study how losing access to hospital-based ED services affects mortality in rural U S counties, focusing on mortality from behavioral health and time-sensitive conditions We argue that there are close links between ED closures and these types of mortality First, EDs often serve as safety-net providers for people with mental health and substance abuse (MH/SA) disorders since rural areas tend to lack specialized behavioral health services (Wishner, 2016 Holland et al 2021) As of 2022, 66 percent of US residents in rural communities lived in areas classified as mental health provider shortage areas (HRSA, 2019) When a rural community loses hospital-based ED services, there may be no alternative place to obtain care for acute events related to MH/SA As of 2019, there were 8 million SArelated ED visits in the US (28 5 SA-related ED visits per 1,000 population), comprising about 6 percent of all ED visits, with about a third of these visits leading to inpatient stays (Owens Moore, 2022) Thus, one mechanism through which ED closure may affect health is the loss of acute care for behavioral health-related needs Second, lack of access to a nearby ED may impede access to care if patients need to travel farther to access services In a study of 64 rural hospitals that closed between 2013 and 2017 and had offered ED services, the GAO reports that the straight-line distance to an ED            1 See https //www shepscenter unc edu/programs-projects/rural-health/rural-hospital-closures/ 3 increased from 3 3 miles in 2012 to 24 2 miles in 2018 for people living in the service areas of the closed hospitals (US GAO, 2020) Thus, in sparsely populated areas, a second mechanism through which ED closure may affect health is greater travel distance, leading to prolonged response time for time-sensitive conditions such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI) Our empirical analysis is based on individual-level data from Vital Statistics death certificate records for the period 2005–2018 and county-level data with information on ED closures and socioeconomic characteristics Given the key role of EDs in rural areas in providing care for individuals with MH/SA disorders, we focus on effects of ED closure on deaths of despair, namely mortality from drug overdose, alcohol liver-related diseases and suicide (Case and Deaton 2015, 2017 and 2020) We also consider mortality from AMI, a particularly time-sensitive condition, to inform how ED closures affect mortality through increasing travel time to treatment We construct a propensity-weighted difference-indifference (DiD) setting by defining the treatment group as rural counties that had hospitalbased ED services at the start of the analysis period but lost ED services during the study period (the definition"}

Evidence from Medicare Part D Pinka Chatterji, Chun-Yu Ho, Tao Jin, and Yichuan Wang NBER Working Paper No 32267 March 2024 JEL No I1,I11,I13 ABSTRACT Since the inception of Medicare Part D in 2006, mergers and acquisitions (M A) and regulatory changes have led to increased concentration and reduced plan variety in the standalone prescription drug plan (PDP) portion of the market We examine how this industry consolidation affects Medicare beneficiaries’ enrollment in PDPs and their out-of-pocket (OOP) drug expenditures using individual-level data from the 2006-2018 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) merged with PDP market-level characteristics Overall, we find that lower plan variety in the PDP market decreases the likelihood that elderly individuals enroll in PDPs, and higher PDP market concentration increases OOP drug expenditures Our main results are robust to considering possible effects of unobserved individual-level heterogeneity, region-specific time trends, and entry/exit of insurers, as well as to the use of an alternative identification scheme based on a quasi-experimental design Further, we find that younger, more advantaged, and healthier individuals respond differently to industry consolidation compared to their older, less advantaged, and sicker counterparts The former groups are more likely to adjust their PDP enrollment in response to reduced PDP variety and have higher OOP drug expenditures in response to increased PDP market concentration compared to the latter groups Finally, we find that not only do lower PDP variety and greater PDP market concentration directly affect PDP enrollment and OOP drug expenditures, but these changes also affect Medicare beneficiaries indirectly through impacting PDP characteristics Pinka Chatterji State University of New York at Albany Economics Department 1400 Washington Avenue Albany, NY 12222 and NBER pchatterji albany edu Chun-Yu Ho Economics Department State University of New York at Albany 1400 Washington Avenue"}

{"id": 43, "text": "on premiums On the one hand, consolidation may result in lower premiums because consolidation leads to scale economies and to insurers having stronger negotiating power against health care providers, which potentially lowers premiums (see, for example, Melnick et al 2011 and Scheffler and Arnold 2017 for evidence on commercial insurance) On the other hand, consolidation in insurer markets can lead to higher premiums because of market power (see Dafny et al 2012 and Trish and Herring 2015 for evidence on commercial insurance Dafny et al 2015 for evidence on ACA Marketplace plans) Prior empirical research shows mixed effects of insurer market consolidation on premiums (see evidence in Scheffler et al 2016 for ACA Marketplace plans Ho and Lee 2017 for commercial insurance Chorniy et al 2020 and Hill and Wagner 2021 for Medicare Part D) We know much less, however, about the effects of insurer market consolidation on outcomes measured at the individual level – such as insurance enrollment decisions and individual drug expenditures - which are closely related to consumers’ wellbeing   Our study, focused on the Medicare Part D stand-alone PDP market, is of particular interest for two reasons First, Part D is crucial in providing financial security for older people to access their outpatient prescription drugs As of 2023, more than 50 million of the 65 million people covered by Medicare were enrolled in Part D plans, with 44% of them enrolled in stand-alone PDPs (Medicare Advantage also offers Part D drug plans, called MAPDs) (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2023b) Second, since the rollout of Medicare Part D, the stand-alone PDP market has become more concentrated over time (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2023b) Also, regulatory changes, such as the “meaningful 5 difference requirement” that was in effect between 2011-19, eliminated some stand-alone PDPs As a result, the number of stand-alone PDPs available decreased from 1,866 in 2007 to 901 in 2019, and the number of insurers offering stand-alone PDPs decreased from 61 in 2007 to 29 in 2019 (see Figure 1) Thus, it is of policy interest to understand how industry consolidation in the Part D standalone PDP market may affect program enrollment and out-of-pocket drug expenditures A notable concern here is that if industry consolidation increases the market power of insurers, it may lead to higher premiums and lower plan quality As a result, consolidation may result in lower PDP enrollment and higher OOP drug expenditures, which potentially harms consumers Our empirical analysis starts with a plan-level dataset of stand-alone PDPs from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Landscape and Enrollment files, which covers the period 2007-2019 across 50 states We define the product as the stand-alone PDP, and the market area is defined as the individual’s current state of residence We construct two measures at the market level to capture industry consolidation The first is the total number of plans in each market divided by the number of residents aged 65 and older This is our measure of plan variety The second variable is the Herfindahl–Hirschman index (HHI), which is computed across all insurers in each market"}
{"id": 44, "text": "second variable is the Herfindahl–Hirschman index (HHI), which is computed across all insurers in each market This is our measure of inter-insurer competition at the market level We match these market-level measures of industry consolidation to individual-level data from the 2006-2018 waves of the restricted version of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) based on each HRS respondent’s state and interview year Then, we estimate the effects of market-level standalone PDP industry consolidation on HRS respondents’ PDP enrollment and OOP drug expenditures Since we include state and year fixed effects (FEs) in our baseline models, identification is based on changes in plan variety and inter-insurer competition over time within markets that deviate from the average Our main findings are that, for our sample individuals, lower plan variety decreases PDP enrollment, and higher concentration increases OOP drug expenditures Our results are robust to 6 considering the effect of unobserved individual heterogeneity, region-specific time trends and the entry/exit of insurers Also, we estimate our model with an instrumental variables (IV) identification strategy We use duplicated stand-alone PDPs and nationwide M As as plausibly exogenous shocks to plan availability and HHI, respectively In particular, the use of duplicated stand-alone PDPs as an instrument is novel in the literature We then estimate our empirical model using a control function approach and find the results are mostly consistent with our main findings Next, we explore heterogeneous effects We find that our main results on PDP enrollment and OOP drug expenditures are driven by younger, more educated, white, and healthier individuals Intuitively, this makes sense since these individuals are likely to be relatively well-off, may have alternative insurance options, and thus would be less likely to participate in a PDP if plan variety decreases Finally, we explore potential channels through which industry consolidation might affect an individual's PDP enrollment and OOP drug expenditures We find that industry consolidation lowers plan variety, which in turn associates with lower average premiums, lower provision of PDPs with full subsidies (plans with zero premiums for beneficiaries eligible for low-income subsidies), and lower provision of PDPs with enhanced options (PDPs with more generous benefits such as lower deductibles and gap coverage) Higher market concentration increases average premiums, potentially through increasing the availability of enhanced plans, and decreases the availability of plans offering a full subsidy These results suggest that insurers exercise market power by price discriminating across consumers with various plan options, which is consistent with Dafny (2010) Interestingly, we elucidate that industry consolidation (in terms of PDP variety and market concentration) not only directly affects beneficiaries' program enrollment and OOP drug expenditures but also indirectly affects consumers through impacting plan attributes This paper contributes to the literature that examines the effects of Medicare Part D on older adults’ outcomes related to prescription drug coverage Duggan and Morton (2010) find that 7 prescription drug use increased significantly among Medicare Part D enrollees, likely due to lower prices Ketcham and Simon (2008) report that OOP costs were reduced significantly among seniors within the first year of the program Engelhardt and Gruber (2011) show that"}

{"id": 46, "text": "either stand-alone PDPs if they enroll in the Medicare Part A and B programs or a MAPD plan which is a Medicare Part C plan plus prescription drug coverage Following existing studies, we treat stand-alone PDPs and MAPDs as two separate product markets and focus on the stand-alone PDP market The MMA of 2003 and subsequent regulations established the basic Part D drug benefit design, beneficiary information requirements, and quality/access standards, as well as set up risk adjustment, risk-sharing, and reinsurance provisions (Hoadley, 2006) However, the law still allowed for substantial flexibility in plan design along characteristics likely to be relevant to consumers, such as the drug formulary and whether the plan includes a deductible or has cost-sharing that varies by drug category Stand-alone PDPs are differentiated from each other in various dimensions First, the premium is a consideration in determining plan choice because the enrollees pay a premium for specific benefits 9 of a plan Second, there are several plan characteristics that are important for plan choice Figure 2 shows the benefit structure of a typical stand-alone PDP In the year 2017 (our analysis period runs from 2007-2019), the standard benefit included an (approximately) $400 deductible and three coverage zones, which are initial coverage, coverage gap (which is called the doughnut hole) and catastrophic coverage After the deductible is exhausted, the enrollee has a co-pay of 25% up to $3,700 in the first coverage period Then, the enrollee enters a coverage gap, during which the enrollee pays 40-51% The exact copay depends on the enhanced plan in which beneficiaries choose to enroll and brand name or generic drugs beneficiaries choose to use Finally, as drug expenses reach $8,071, beneficiaries reach the catastrophic coverage threshold After that point, they pay 5% of total drug costs M A activities have been a driving force shaping the competitive landscape of the Medicare Part D market At the time of Medicare Part D’s inception, 65 different organizations offered more than 1,400 plan options, with a typical state offering 40-45 plans provided by 15-20 organizations (Hoadley, 2006) Figure 3 depicts the nationwide market shares of top insurers providing Medicare Part D PDP plans In 2007, United Health and Humana covered 20% and 17% of total enrollment, with the remaining divided among dozens of others By 2019, the market had become more concentrated CVS Health covered 21% of the total enrollment, followed by Humana (14 percent) and United Health (14 percent) The top three insurers had about half of the total enrollment This industry consolidation has been attracting the concern of the Department of Justice (DOJ) Notably, in the CVS-Aetna merger in 2019, the DOJ reviewed the merger and approved it conditional on the divestiture of Aetna’s Part D businesses to WellCare (US Department of Justice, 2018) Another driving force affecting the competitive landscape of the Medicare Part D market is regulatory policy In particular, over the period 2011-19, CMS imposed the “meaningful difference requirement” for stand-alone PDPs offered by the same insurers in the same region CMS required Part D insurers that offer more than one"}
{"id": 47, "text": "same insurers in the same region CMS required Part D insurers that offer more than one plan per market to demonstrate meaningful differences 10 between their plans, in terms of premiums, cost sharing, formulary design, or other benefits Insurers were allowed to offer only one basic plan benefit design in a market and no more than two enhanced alternative plans in each market (CMS, 2018) The meaningful difference requirement aimed to reduce beneficiaries’ confusion about their options and to improve the quality of plan choice However, it forces insurers to consolidate their plans, which reduces beneficiaries’ options and potentially reduces competition among insurers Overall, then, both M A activities and regulatory changes have led to the Medicare Part D market to become more concentrated  3 Data We utilize two datasets for our empirical analysis First, we use detailed plan-level data from the CMS Landscape Files Data It includes on average 1,429 stand-alone PDPs per year These data span 12 years from 2007, the year after Medicare Part D was introduced, to 2019 and cover 50 states and 34 regions from CMS We employ this dataset to compute the two measures of competition at the market level Second, we use individual-level data from the 2006-2018 waves of RAND HRS, which is a longitudinal survey of Americans over 50 years old and their spouses About 20,000 people take part in this survey in each wave (every 2 years) We employ this dataset to examine program enrollment and OOP at the individual level  3 1 Plan-Level Data We construct two variables of interest from the CMS dataset The first is the total number of PDPs per 10,000 senior residents in a market, where each market is defined at state level We denote this variable as NPlan, which measures plan variety The second variable is the HHI, which is computed across all insurers in each market The HHI is defined as the sum of the squared market shares of each insurer multiplied by 10,000 The market shares of each insurer are determined by 11 adding the enrollment of all plans offered by the same insurer in a market and dividing this number by the total enrollment of all insurers in the market As a result, the HHI captures inter-insurer competition at the market level HHI values of 0 indicate perfect competition, while index values of 10,000 indicate monopoly Figure 4 depicts that the number of PDPs per 10,000 senior residents in a market decreases from 1 32 in 2007 to 0 41 in 2019 Similarly, the HHI in a market increases from the lowest point 1,717 in 2010 to 2,060 in 2019 It suggests higher concentration in the Medicare Part D PDP market over time Further, we illustrate the heterogeneities in the number of plans offered and the HHI across markets and years Figure 5 depicts the distribution of the number of PDPs and HHI across markets The distribution of the number of PDPs offered per 10,000 senior residents is right skewed The majority of markets have fewer than 1 PDP offered per 10,000"}

{"id": 70, "text": "several healthcare systems in five U S states over the period October to November 2020 suggests that 8% of respondents did not have any plans to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (Shekhar et al , 2021) Other studies in the U S report hesitancy rates between 8 and 16 4% (Biswas et al , 2021) Immunization is important for healthcare workers for at least two reasons First, remaining unvaccinated while working in a healthcare facility could increase the risk of patients becoming infected with the virus Second, working unvaccinated in the healthcare setting could increase the risk of infection among the workers (unvaccinated and vaccinated), which could exacerbate the healthcare worker shortage COVID-19 vaccine mandates have proven to be an effective policy for increasing vaccine take-up in the general population outside the U S Cross-country studies find that these mandates increase vaccination rates in Canada, Germany, France, and Italy (Karaivanov et al , 2022 Fitzpatrick et al , 2023) COVID-19 vaccine mandates in the U S also show a positive impact on the general population’s vaccination rates, with effects appearing as early as three weeks following the mandates’ implementation dates (Howard-Williams et al , 2022 Okpani et al , 2024) McGarry et al (2022) and Reses et al (2023) study the effect of these mandates in 15 states using the National Healthcare Safety Network and suggest that these mandates increase the COVID-19 vaccination rate among healthcare workers in nursing home facilities, but with no observed impact on staff shortages Earlier studies also show that state influenza vaccination requirements for hospital workers 1995-2017 increased the vaccination rate among healthcare workers by 4 2% (Lindley et al , 2019), and reduced pneumonia and influenza mortality rates by 3These numbers are current as of February 20, 2024 4Military personnel were the first professional group in the U S mandated to receive COVID-19 vaccines after the Food Drug Administration approved the Pfizer vaccine (Elliott and Chambers, 2022) 5 2 5% (Carrera et al , 2021) Although there are no unified state-representative databases tracking the vaccination rates among healthcare workers in the U S covering our analysis period,5 some states report these statistics for a limited time period in which many state-level healthcare worker COVID-19 vaccination mandates took effect For example, the state of Maine reports monthly statistics for May-October 2021 6 Using a pre-post design, these data suggest a 24% increase in COVID-19 vaccination rates among healthcare workers in October 2021, one month after the mandate became effective in September 2021, compared to August 2021, showing an increase from 78% to 97% The healthcare industry labor shortage is a multifaceted problem including heightened demand for healthcare services in the baby boomer generation and increases in longevity due to advances in medical care Based on pre-COVID-19 research in the U S , healthcare workers’ burnout during COVID-19 pandemic likely exacerbated ongoing healthcare worker shortages (Willard-Grace et al , 2019) and increased medical errors (Shanafelt et al , 2010) Staff shortages may delay admitting patients to healthcare facilities and prevent patients from receiving quality care due to the increased"}

The basic idea is that the expansion of European overseas empires starting at the end of the fifteenth century caused major changes in the organi- zation of many of these societies In fact, historical and econo- metric evidence suggests that European colonialism caused an \"institutional reversal\" European colonialism led to the develop- ment of institutions of private property in previously poor areas, while introducing extractive institutions or maintaining existing extractive institutions in previously prosperous places 2 The main reason for the institutional reversal is that relatively poor regions were sparsely populated, and this enabled or induced Europeans to settle in large numbers and develop institutions encouraging investment In contrast, a large population and rela- tive prosperity made extractive institutions more profitable for the colonizers for example, the native population could be forced to work in mines and plantations, or taxed by taking over existing tax and tribute systems The expansion of European overseas"}

This question is relevant in thinking about the causes of the reversal For example, if the reversal is related to the extraction of resources from, and the \"plunder\" of, the former colonies, or to the direct effect of the diseases Europeans brought to the New World, it should have taken place shortly after colonization Figure IV shows that the reversal is mostly a late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century phenomenon, and is closely related to industrialization Figure IVa compares the evolution of urban- ization among two groups of New World ex-colonies, those with low urbanization in 1500 versus those with high urbanization in 1500 12 We focus on New World colonies since the societies came 12 The initially high urbanization countries for which we have data and are included in the figure are Bolivia, Mexico, Peru, and all of Central America, while the initially low urbanization countries are Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, and the United States REVERSAL OF FORTUNE 1257 30 25 20 0 c 0 J is- cP 5 0 800 1000 1200 1300 1400 1500 1600 1700 1750 1800 1850 1900 1920 ---Countnries with low urbanization in 1500 --- Countries with high urbanization in 1500 -x- India -a US FIGURE IVa Urbanization Rate in India, the United States, and New World Countries with Low and High Urbanization, 800-1920 Note Urbanization is population living in urban areas divided by total popula- tion Urban areas have a minimum threshold of 20,000 inhabitants, from Chan- dler [1987], and Mitchell [1993, 1995] Low urbanization in 1500 countries are Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, and the United States High urbanization in 1500 countries are Bolivia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, and all of Central America For details see Appendix 1 under European dominance very early on The averages plotted in the figure are weighted by population in 1500 In addition, in the same figure we plot India and the United States separately (as well as including it in"}

{"id": 126, "text": "nologies that were crucial for progress in temperate areas include the heavy plow, systems of crop rotation, domesticated animals such as cattle and sheep, and some of the high productivity European crops, including wheat and barley Despite the key role of these technologies for temperate areas, they have had much less of an effect on tropical zones [Lewis 1978] Sachs [2001, p 12] also implies this view in his recent paper when he adapts Dia- mond's argument about the geography of technological diffusion \"Since technologies in the critical areas of agriculture, health, and related areas could diffuse within ecological zones, but not across ecological zones, economic development spread through the tem- 13 Put differently, in the simple geography hypothesis, geography has a main effect on economic performance, which can be expressed as Yit = o + al - G + vt + Eit, where Y, is a measure of economic performance in country i at time t, Gi is a measure of geographic characteristics, vt is a time effect, and eit measures other country-time- specific factors In contrast, in the sophisticated geography view, the relationship between income and geography would be Yi, = ao + al Git + (X2 Tt Gi + vt + Eit, where Tt is a time-varying characteristic of the world as a whole or of the state of technology According to this view, the major role that geography plays in history is not through o2, but through a2 REVERSAL OF FORTUNE 1261 perate zones but not through the tropical regions\" (italics in the original also see Myrdal [1968], Ch 14) The evidence is not favorable to the view that the reversal reflects the emergence of agricultural technologies favorable to temperate areas, however First, the regressions in Tables III, IV, and V show little evidence that the reversal was related to geo- graphic characteristics Second, the temperate drift hypothesis suggests that the reversal should be associated with the spread of European agricultural technologies Yet in practice, while Euro- pean agricultural technology spread to the colonies between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries (e g , McCusker and Menard [1985], Ch 3 for North America), the reversal in relative incomes is largely a late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century, and industry-based phenomenon In light of the result that the reversal is related to industri- alization, another sophisticated geography hypothesis would be that certain geographic characteristics facilitate or enable indus- trialization First, one can imagine that there is more room for specialization in industry, but such specialization requires trade If countries differ according to their transport costs, it might be those with low transport costs that take off during the age of industry This argument is not entirely convincing, however, again because there is little evidence that the reversal was re- lated to geographic characteristics (see Tables III, IV, and V) Moreover, many of the previously prosperous colonies that failed to industrialize include islands such as the Caribbean, or coun- tries with natural ports such as those in Central America, India, or Indonesia Moreover, transport costs appear to have been relatively low in"}

{"id": 128, "text": "these high working hours could reflect other factors Second, it can be argued that different paths of development reflect the direct influence of Europeans Places where there are more Europeans have become richer, either because Europeans brought certain values conducive to develop- ment (e g , Landes [1998], and Hall and Jones [1999]), or because having more Europeans confers certain benefits (e g , through trade with Europe or because Europeans are more productive) In Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson [2001b] we presented evidence showing that the reversal and current income levels are not related to the current racial composition of the population or to proxies of whether the colonies were culturally or politically dominated by Europeans REVERSAL OF FORTUNE 1263 the property rights of this elite are secure In such a society, many of the agents with the entrepreneurial human capital and invest- ment opportunities may be those without effective property rights protection In particular, the concentration of political and social power in the hands of a small elite implies that the majority of the population risks being held up by the powerful elite after they undertake investments This is also consistent with North and Weingast's [1989, pp 805-806] emphasis that what matters is \"  whether the state produces rules and regulations that bene- fit a small elite and so provide little prospect for long-run growth, or whether it produces rules that foster long-term growth \" Whether political power is broad-based or concentrated in the hands of a small elite is crucial in evaluating the role of institu- tions in the experiences of the Caribbean or India during colonial times, where the property rights of the elite were well enforced, but the majority of the population had no civil rights or property rights It is important to emphasize that \"equilibrium institutions\" may be extractive, even though such institutions do not encour- age economic development This is because institutions are shaped, at least in part, by politically powerful groups that may obtain fewer rents with institutions of private property (e g , North [1990]), or fear losing their political power if there is institutional development (e g , Acemoglu and Robinson [2000, 2001]), or simply may be reluctant to initiate institutional change because they would not be the direct beneficiaries of the resulting economic gains In the context of the development experience of the former colonies, this implies that equilibrium institutions are likely to have been designed to maximize the rents to European colonists, not to maximize long-run growth The organization of society and institutions also persist (see, for example, the evidence presented in Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson [2001al) Therefore, the institutions hypothesis also suggests that societies that are prosperous today should tend to be prosperous in the future However, if a major shock disrupts the organization of a society, this will affect its economic perfor- mance We argue that European colonialism not only disrupted existing social organizations, but led to the establishment of, or continuation of already existing, extractive institutions in previ- ously prosperous areas and to the development of institutions"}

And why was extraction more likely in relatively prosperous areas? Two factors appear important 1 The economic profitability of alternative policies When extractive institutions were more profitable, Europeans were more likely to opt for them High population density, by providing a supply of labor that could be forced to work in agriculture or mining, made extractive institutions more profitable for the Europeans 17 For example, the presence of abundant Amerindian labor in Meso-America was conducive to the establishment of forced labor sys- tems, while the relatively high population density in Af- rica created a profit opportunity for slave traders in sup- plying labor to American plantations s\" Other types of extractive institutions were also more profitable in densely settled and prosperous areas where there was more to be extracted by European colonists Furthermore, in these densely settled areas there was often an existing system of tax administration or tribute the large popula- tion made it profitable for the Europeans to take control of these systems and to continue to levy high taxes (see, e g , Wilks [1975] for Ghana, Law [1977] for Nigeria, Harms [1981]) for the Congo/ Zaire, and Miller [1988] on Angola 17 The Caribbean islands were relatively densely settled in 1500 Much of the population in these islands died soon after the arrival of the Europeans because of the diseases that the Europeans brought (e g , Crosby [1986] and McNeill [1976]) It is possible that the initial high populations in these islands induced the Europeans to take the \"extractive institutions\" path, and subse- quently, these institutions were developed further with the import of slaves from Africa An alternative possibility is that the relevant period of institutional development was after the major population decline, but the Caribbean still ended up with extractive institutions because the soil and the climate were suitable for sugar production, which encouraged Europeans to import slaves from Africa and set up labor-oppressive systems (e g , Dunn [1972] and Engerman and Sokoloff [1997, 2000]) 18 The Spanish conquest around the La Plata River (current day Argentina) during the early sixteenth century provides a nice example of how population density affected European colonization (see Lockhart and Schwartz [1983, pp 259-260] or Denoon [1983, pp 23-24]) Early in 1536, a large Spanish expedition arrived in the area, and founded the city of Buenos Aires at the mouth of the river Plata The area was sparsely inhabited by nonsedentary Indians The Spaniards could not enslave a sufficient number of Indians for food production Starvation forced them to abandon Buenos Aires and retreat up the river to a post at Asuncion (current day Paraguay) This area was more densely settled by semi- sedentary Indians, who were enslaved by the Spaniards the colony of Paraguay, with relatively extractive institutions, was founded Argentina was finally colo- nized later, with a higher proportion of European settlers and little forced labor 1266 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS Wiegersma"}

And how did this institutional reversal cause the reversal in relative incomes and the subsequent divergence in income per capita across the various colonies? We argued that the institu- tional reversal resulted from the differential profitability of alter- native colonization strategies in different environments In pros- perous and densely settled areas, Europeans introduced or maintained already-existing extractive institutions to force the local population to work in mines and plantations, and took over existing tax and tribute systems In contrast, in previously sparsely settled areas, Europeans settled in large numbers and created institutions of private property, providing secure prop- erty rights to a broad cross section of the society and encouraging commerce and industry This institutional reversal laid the seeds of the reversal in relative incomes But most likely, the scale of the reversal and the subsequent divergence in incomes are due to the emergence of the opportunity to industrialize during the nineteenth century While societies with extractive institutions or those with highly hierarchical structures could exploit avail- able agricultural technologies relatively effectively, the spread of industrial technology required the participation of a broad cross section of the society-the smallholders, the middle class, and the entrepreneurs The age of industry, therefore, created a consid- erable advantage for societies with institutions of private prop- erty Consistent with this view, we documented that these societies took much better advantage of the opportunity to industrialize 1280 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS APPENDIX 1 URBANIZATION ESTIMATES This is a shortened version of the Appendix in Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson [2001b] 1 Urbanization in 1500 Our base estimates for 1500 consist of Bairoch's [1988] as- sessment of urbanization augmented by the work of Eggimann [1999] Merging these two series requires us to convert Eggi- mann's estimates, based on a minimum population threshold of 20,000, into Bairoch-equivalent urbanization estimates, based on a minimum population threshold of 5000 To construct our base data, we run a regression of Bairoch estimates on Eggimann estimates for all countries where they overlap in 1900 (the year for which we have the largest number of Bairoch estimates for non-European countries) There are thir- teen countries for"}

{"id": 153, "text": "The Economic Lives of the Poor Abhijit V Banerjee and Esther Duﬂo I n what turned out to be a rhetorical master-move, the 1990 World Development Report from the World Bank deﬁned the “extremely poor” people of the world as those who are currently living on no more than $1 per day per person, measured at the 1985 purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rate In 1993, the poverty line was updated to $1 08 per person per day at the 1993 PPP exchange rate, which is the line we use in this paper Poverty lines have always existed—indeed $1 per day was chosen in part because of its proximity to the poverty lines used by many poor countries 1 However the $1-a-day poverty line has come to dominate the conversations about poverty to a remarkable extent But how actually does one live on less than $1 per day? This essay is about the economic lives of the extremely poor the choices they face, the constraints they grapple with, and the challenges they meet The available evidence on the economic lives of the extremely poor is incomplete in many important ways However, a number of recent data sets and a body of new research have added a lot to what we know about their lives, and taken together there is enough to start building an image of the way the extremely poor live their lives Our discussion of the economic lives of the extremely poor builds on household surveys conducted in 13 countries listed in Table 1 Cote d’Ivoire, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, South Africa, Tanzania, and Timor Leste (East Timor) We mainly use the Living 1 For example, the “All India Rural” poverty line used by the Indian Planning Commission was 328 rupees per person per month, or $32 in purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars in 1999/2000 y Abhijit V Banerjee and Esther Duﬂo are both Professors of Economics and Directors of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts Journal of Economic Perspectives—Volume 21, Number 1—Winter 2007—Pages 141–167 Standard Measurement Surveys (LSMS) conducted by the World Bank and the “Family Life Surveys” conducted by the Rand Corporation, all of which are publicly available In addition, we also use two surveys that we conducted in India with our collaborators The ﬁrst was carried out in 2002 and 2003 in 100 hamlets of Udaipur District, Rajasthan (Banerjee, Deaton, and Duﬂo, 2004) Udaipur is one of the poorer districts of India, with a large tribal population and an unusually high level of female illiteracy (At the time of the 1991 census, only 5 percent of women were literate in rural Udaipur ) Our second survey covered 2,000 households in “slums” (or informal neighborhoods) of Hyderabad, the capital of the state of Andhra Pradesh and one of the boomtowns of post-liberalization India (Banerjee, Duﬂo, Table 1 Description of Data Sets Country Source Year Avg monthly consumption per capita (In PPP$) Households (HHs) living on less than $1 08 per person per day $2"}

Or is the answer as simple as a lack of access to movie theaters? The propensity to own a radio or a television, a widespread form of entertainment for American households, varies considerably across low-income countries For example, among rural households living under $1 per day, ownership of a radio is 11 percent in the Udaipur survey, almost 60 percent in Nicaragua and Guatemala, and above 70 percent in South Africa and Peru Similarly, no one owns a television in Udaipur, but in Guatemala nearly a quarter of households do, and in Nicaragua, the percentage is closer to a half These phenomena of spending on festivals and ownership of radios or televisions"}

{"id": 160, "text": "to expenditure per capita of about a quarter for the poorest Brazilians Another way to make the same point is to look at what edibles the extremely poor are buying Deaton and Subramanian (1996) note that among grains, in terms of calories per rupee, the millets (jowar and bajra) are clearly the best buy Yet in their data, only about two-thirds of the total spending on grains is on these grains, while another 20 percent is on rice, which costs more than twice as much per calorie, and a further 10 percent or so is spent on wheat, which is a 70 percent more expensive way to get calories In addition, the poor spend almost 7 percent of their total budget on sugar, which is both more expensive than grains as a source of calories and bereft of other nutritional value The same afﬁnity for sugar also shows up in our Udaipur data, in which the poor spend almost 10 percent of their food budget on the category “sugar, salt, and other processed foods” (this does not include cooking oil, which makes up another 6 percent of the expenditures on food) Even for the extremely poor, for every 1 percent increase in the food expenditure, about half goes into purchasing more calories, and half goes into purchasing more expensive (and presumably better tasting) calories less costly in some countries than others, while traded goods tend to be more similarly priced, so people at the same expenditure levels at purchasing power parity can have widely differing levels of purchasing power in terms of traded goods Abhijit V Banerjee and Esther Duﬂo 147 Finally, the trend seems to be to spend even less money on food In India, for example, spending on food went from 70 percent in 1983 to 62 percent in 1999–2000, and the share of millet in the food budget dropped to virtually zero (Deaton, 2006) Not surprisingly, the poor are also consuming fewer calories over time (Meenakshi and Vishwanathan, 2003), though this change may also reﬂect that their work involves less physical effort (Jha, 2004) The Ownership of Assets While all the surveys have some information about assets, the list of assets varies To obtain a relatively coherent list across countries, we focus on radios, televisions, and bicycles The share of people who own these particular assets varies signiﬁcantly across countries As we already discussed, ownership of radio and television varies from country to country, but is low in some countries One reason may be the lack of signal Another reason may be that a television is an expensive and lumpy transaction for which one has to save if one is born poor We do see a fairly steep income gradient in the ownership of radio and television In all countries, the share of rural households owning a television is substantially larger for those who live on less than $2 a day than those living on less than $1 a day For example, the share owning a television increases from 14 percent for those living on $1 a day to"}

According to Deaton and Subramanian (1996), the poorest people—the ones in the bottom decile in terms of per capita expenditure—consume on average slightly less than 1400 calories a day This level is about half of what the Indian government recommends for a man with moderate activity, or a woman with heavy physical activity (see \u0001http //www fao org/documents/show cdr asp?url"}

Risk-spreading is clearly one reason why the poor, who might ﬁnd risk especially hard to bear, tend not to be too specialized in any one occupation They work part time outside agriculture to reduce their exposure to farming risk, and keep a foot in agriculture to avoid being too dependent on their nonagricultural jobs Another reason for a second job is to occupy what would otherwise be wasted time When we asked the dosa-sellers of Guntur why they did so many other things as well, they all said “[We] can sell dosas in the morning What do we do for the rest of the day?” Similarly, farmers who do not have irrigated land can only farm when The Economic Lives of the Poor 161 the land is not too dry Finding some work outside agriculture is a way for them to make productive use of their time when the land is unusable However, this argument is incomplete We also need to explain what made the women opt to sell dosas After all they could have skipped the dosas and specialized in whatever they were doing for the rest of the day Risk spreading remains a possible answer, but many of them seem to be in relatively safe occupations Given the fact that almost everyone owns the cooking implement that one needs to make a dosa and entry is free, it"}
{"id": 176, "text": "owns the cooking implement that one needs to make a dosa and entry is free, it does not seem that dosa-making is an extraordinarily proﬁtable activity A ﬁnal, more compelling reason for multiple jobs is that the poor cannot raise the capital they would need to run a business that would occupy them fully As we saw, most businesses operate with very little assets and little working capital Likewise, some poor farmers might be able to irrigate their lands and make them useable for a larger part of the year, but they lack the necessary access to funds Of course, in agriculture, some downtime will always remain, justifying some amount of diversiﬁcation of jobs But such downtime would be much more limited than what the data actually reveals Why So Many Entrepreneurs? Once we draw this link between the tendency of the poor to be in multiple occupations and their access to ﬁnancial markets, it is clear why so many of the poor are entrepreneurs If you have few skills and little capital, and especially if you are a woman, being an entrepreneur is often easier than ﬁnding an employer with a job to offer You buy some fruits and vegetables or some plastic toys at the wholesalers and start selling them on the street you make some extra dosa mix and sell the dosas in front of your house you collect cow dung and dry it to sell it as a fuel you attend to one cow and collect the milk These types of activities are exactly those in which the poor are involved It is important not to romanticize these penniless entrepreneurs Given that they have no money, borrowing is risky, and no one wants to lend to them, the businesses they run are inevitably extremely small, to the point where there are clearly unrealized economies of scale Moreover, given that so many of these ﬁrms have more family labor available to them than they can use, they do very little to create jobs for others Of course, this pattern makes it harder for anyone to ﬁnd a job and hence reinforces the proliferation of petty entrepreneurs Why Don’t the Poor Eat More? Another puzzle is why the poor do not spend more on food both on average and especially out of the marginal dollar Eating more and eating better (more grains and iron-rich foods, less sugar) would help them build their body-mass indices to healthier levels One possibility is that eating more would not help them that much, or not for long, because they would become weak again at the ﬁrst attack of disease, which will invariably occur For example, Deaton, Cutler, and Lleras-Muney (2006) argue that 162 Journal of Economic Perspectives nutrition is at best a very small part of what explains the tremendous gains in health around the world in the past few decades However, some improvements in nutrition (reduction of anemia in particular) have been linked to increased productivity (Thomas et al , 2004) Moreover, as we saw, not having enough to eat does, at a"}
{"id": 177, "text": "et al , 2004) Moreover, as we saw, not having enough to eat does, at a minimum, make the poor extremely unhappy Provided that eating more would increase their productivity, it is unlikely that the low levels of good consumption can be explained by a simple lack of self control (that is, the poor cannot resist temptations to spend on things other than food) As we noted above, the poor also spend surprisingly large amounts on entertainment televisions, weddings, or festivals All of these involve spending a large amount at one time, which implies some saving unless they happen to be especially creditworthy In other words, many poor people save money that they could have eaten today to spend more on entertainment in the future, which does not immediately ﬁt the idea that they lack self-control The need to spend more on entertainment rather than on food appears to be a strongly felt need, not a result of inadequate planning One reason this might be the case is that the poor want to keep up with their neighbors Fafchamps and Shilpi (2006) offer evidence from Nepal in which people were asked to assess whether their level of income as well as their levels of consumption of housing, food, clothing, health care, and schooling were adequate The answers to these questions were strongly negatively related to the average consumption of the other people living in the same village Why Don’t the Poor Invest More in Education? The children of the poor are, by and large, going to primary school However, parents are not reacting to the low quality of these schools, either by sending their children to better and more expensive schools or by putting pressure on the government to do something about quality in government schools Why not? One reason is that poor parents, who may often be illiterate themselves, may have a hard time recognizing that their children are not learning much Poor parents in Eastern Uttar Pradesh in India have limited success in predicting whether their school-age children can read (Banerjee et al , 2006) Moreover, how can parents be conﬁdent that a private school would offer a better education, given that the teacher there is usually less qualiﬁed than the public school teachers? After all, researchers have only discovered this pattern in the last few years As for putting pressure on the government, it is not clear that the average villager would know how to organize and do so Why Don’t the Poor Save More? The arguments based on lack of access to credit and insurance or labor market rigidities, by themselves, do not help very much in understanding why the poor are not more interested in accumulating wealth After all, the poor could easily save more without getting less nutrition, by spending less on alcohol, tobacco, festivals, and food items such as sugar, spice, and tea Abhijit V Banerjee and Esther Duﬂo 163 It is true that the poor typically have no bank accounts or other ﬁnancial assets with which to save, but many of them have their"}
{"id": 178, "text": "bank accounts or other ﬁnancial assets with which to save, but many of them have their own businesses, and these tend to be chronically underfunded So why not save up to buy a new machine, or increase the stock in the shop? Moreover, as we saw above, a very substantial fraction of the poor have debt, and the interest rate on the debt often exceeds 3 percent per month Paying down debt is therefore a very attractive way to save Even if you have no business to grow, and have no debt to repay, just holding some extra stocks for the proverbial rainy day (or “the drought”) can save both worry and the misery of watching your children go hungry In other words, precautionary motives for saving should be especially strong for the poor Part of the answer is probably that saving at home is hard The money may be stolen (especially if you live in a house that cannot be locked) or grabbed by your spouse or your son Also, if you have money at hand, you are constantly resisting temptation to spend to buy something, to help someone to whom you ﬁnd it difﬁcult to say “no,” to give your child a treat Such temptations may be especially hard for the poor, because many of the temptations they are resisting are things that everyone else might take for granted The poor seem aware of their vulnerability to temptation In the Hyderabad survey, the respondents were asked to name whether they would like to cut particular expenses, and 28 percent of the poor named at least one item The top item that households would like to cut is alcohol and tobacco (mentioned by 44 percent of the households that want to cut on items) Then came sugar, tea, and snacks (9 percent), festivals (7 percent), and entertainment (7 percent) Self-knowledge does not help in addressing self-control problems in fact, self-knowledge about a lack of self-control means that you know your saving will probably just end up feeding some future indefensible craving, and the machine for which you are trying to save will never actually be bought Being naı¨ve might actually help—you might be lucky and save enough to buy the machine before the temptation gets to you Beyond Market Failures and Self-control Problems An interesting example that spans many of the arguments we have used above is a study by Duﬂo, Kremer, and Robinson (2006) on investment in fertilizer in Kenya According to surveys conducted over several years, just 40 3 percent of farmers had ever used fertilizer, and just 25 percent used fertilizer in any given year Conservative estimates suggest that the average return to using fertilizer exceeds 100 percent, and the median return is above 75 percent Duﬂo, Kremer, and Robinson conducted ﬁeld trials of fertilizer on the farms of actual randomly selected farmers, which were meant to teach the farmers how to use fertilizer and the rewards of doing so They found that the farmers who participated in the study are 10 percent more likely on average to"}
{"id": 179, "text": "that the farmers who participated in the study are 10 percent more likely on average to use fertilizer in the very next season after the study, but only 10 percent more likely—and the effects fade after the ﬁrst season 164 Journal of Economic Perspectives When farmers were asked why they did not use fertilizer, most farmers replied that they did not have enough money However, fertilizer can be purchased (and used) in small quantities, so this investment opportunity seems accessible to farmers with even a small level of saving The main issue, once again, appears to be that farmers ﬁnd it difﬁcult to save even small sums of money The program in Kenya offered to sell farmers a voucher right after the harvest, which is when farmers have money in hand, which would entitle them to buy fertilizer later This program had a large effect 39 percent of the farmers offered the voucher bought the fertilizer the effects are as large as a 50 percent subsidy on the cost of fertilizer The voucher seemed to work as a commitment device to encourage saving But a puzzle remains farmers could have bought the fertilizer in advance on their own Indeed, a huge majority of the farmers who bought the vouchers for future delivery of fertilizer requested immediate delivery, and then stored the fertilizer for later use Moreover, almost all of them used the fertilizer they bought They apparently had no self-control problems in keeping the fertilizer, even though they could easily exchange the fertilizer for something more immediately consumable Why Don’t the Poor Migrate for Longer? A ﬁnal puzzle is why the poor do not migrate for longer periods, given that they could easily earn much more by doing so Munshi and Rosenzweig (2005) argue that the lack of long-term migration reﬂects the value of remaining close to one’s social network in a setting where the social network might be the only source of (informal) insurance available to people Those who migrate for short periods of up to a few months leave their entire family, who presumably can maintain their social links, behind However, the ultimate reason seems to be that making more money is not a huge priority, or at least not a large enough priority to experience several months of living alone and often sleeping on the ground in or around the work premises In some ways this puzzle resembles the question of why the Kenyan farmers do not buy fertilizer right after the harvest even though they are happy to buy (and use it) if someone made the (small) effort to bring it to their farm In both cases, one senses a reluctance of poor people to commit themselves psychologically to a project of making more money Perhaps at some level this avoidance is emotionally wise thinking about the economic problems of life must make it harder to avoid confronting the sheer inadequacy of the standard of living faced by the extremely poor y We thank Andrei Shleifer for motivating us to undertake this exercise We thank him and the"}

WHERE IS IT? IS IT GETTING WORSE? Everyone is aware that there is a lot of poverty in the world, irrespective of how economists choose to measure it, and that it is disproportionately concentrated in Asia and Africa Nevertheless, it is useful to confirm these impressions with careful measurement It is even more useful to identify relevant correlates of poverty, as a first step in diagnosing the problem Has poverty grown over the past century, or the past few decades? How does it relate to growth, globalization, overpopulation, or any other possible cause or symptom that we care about? What are the Millenium Development Goals with respect to poverty reduction? Do the facts suggest anything about suitable policies? The first essay in the volume, by Angus Deaton, introduces some of the key issues concerning poverty measurement As he argues, poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon encompassing lack of access to various basic necessities, such as nutrition, health, education, housing, security, and opportunity for future improvement Yet there is a need for measures simple enough to grasp and remember that can be compared across space and time otherwise it is easy to get lost in a morass of statistical detail This is the idea that the poverty line serves It sets a standard for what it means to be poor, usually defined in terms of the amount of money needed to achieve some accepted standard of consumption This, obviously, still leaves a lot that is open to disagreement Should the standard be met on the basis of nutritional requirements? Or on the basis of some vision of what people ought to have? How does one adjust for differences in the cost of living, or the variations in the exchange rates? Should one simply count the number of people below the poverty line, or should one give more weight to the depth of poverty?

The measure of poverty most frequently used and reported (for instance, by policy makers, multilateral institutions, or the media) is the number of people living below (i e , with consumption below) a poverty line of either $1 or $2 per day, expressed in terms of 1993 U S dollars, adjusting for differences in purchasing power across different currencies This corresponds quite closely to the poverty lines used in the poorest countries In terms of these measures, there is indeed a lot of poverty Approximately 1 2 billion people—about a fifth of the world’s population—fell below the extreme poverty line of $1 a day in the late 1990s If we use the $2 line, this number rises to 2 8 billion, more than half the world’s population Most global poverty is concentrated in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where the proportions of people in extreme poverty were 40% and 46%, respectively, in 1998 Of the 1 2 billion, over 800 million were located in these two regions, and another 280 million in East Asia (including China) One therefore has to focus particularly on Asia and sub-Saharan Africa when thinking of problems of global poverty Using other dimensions of basic needs points to the same general pattern The 2004 Human Development Report shows that of the 831 million people who were undernourished in the year 2000, sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia, and South Asia, respectively, accounted for 185 million, 212 million, and 312 million Of the 104 million primary school-age children not in school, they included 44, 14, and 32 million, respectively Of the 11 million children under the age of five dying each year, 5, 1, and 4 million of them were in these three regions They also had 273 million, 453 million, and 225 million people without access to improved water sources, out of a global total of 1 2 billion 1 The crude method of using a simple consumption threshold of $1 or $2 thus appears to capture many other relevant dimensions of poverty as well The Millenium Development Goals, adopted by a United Nations summit of representatives of 189 countries in September 2000, consist of eight objectives to be achieved by 2015, covering poverty, hunger, primary education, gender equality, child mortality, and access to water and sanitation The measure of extreme poverty (proportion below $1 a day) is sought to be reduced by half of the 1990 levels by the year 2015 Most projections show that these goals are unlikely to be met on the basis of current performance in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as in countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the CIS The goals for universal primary education and for reducing child mortality by two-thirds are expected to be at least one hundred years away in sub-Saharan Africa, and no dates can be set for achievement of the goals concerning hunger, poverty, and access to sanitation, because performance in these areas is currently worsening in sub-Saharan Africa rather than im-proving 2 There has been some recent controversy concerning poverty estimates and projections into the future, not"}

Comparing households with differing incomes and education profiles, one observes that those with higher labor earnings and mother’s education have fewer children, while those with higher income from agricultural land rents have more Hence the composition of income sources matters considerably, which is consistent with the predictions of economic theory These results suggest that fertility levels can be influenced by policies that promote women’s education, urbanization, and the dissemination of subsidized birth control procedures Mukesh Eswaran widens the scope of this discussion by describing a range of institutional features of poor countries that encourage families to have a large number of children Apart from a lack of women’s education, these include the reliance of parents on children for old-age support and, before the parents reach old age, for income from child labor high levels of infant mortality gender inequality within households and a preference for male children Many of these features can be influenced by policy choices, such as public schooling, health, and social insurance The empowerment of women within households can be enhanced by widening opportunities for them to obtain education, work outside the home, receive loans, and be entitled to own land or other assets on par with males Overall, there seems to be little basis for the fatalistic notion that nothing can be done about problems of overpopulation instead, all the evidence points in the opposite direction There are numerous examples of countries or states, such as Sri Lanka, Costa Rica, and the state of Kerala in India, that have achieved significant reductions in fertility rates by investing in widespread education of women and in public health The next essay, by Jean-Jacques Laffont, addresses the question of why corruption tends to be a particular problem for developing countries He sketches a theory of three successive stages of development, in each of which the extent of corruption is determined by the pattern of specialization of tasks within the government, along with the resources it has available for combating corruption Traditional societies tend to be characterized by relatively low levels of corruption owing to the smallness, simplicity, and high levels of monitoring of the decisions of leaders by the society’s members Developing societies, characterized by an increasing size and complexity of public decision-making, tend to involve more delegation of authority by political leaders to bureaucrats, which leads to the emergence of corruption The scope for such corruption grows initially with the level of development, while the means available to the government for combating it are limited At later stages of development, political leaders have greater"}

Both Udry and Basu first explain why “popular” remedies such as outright bans, trade sanctions, and boycotts are at best ineffective and quite possibly counterproductive means of reducing child labor Basu argues that the historical evidence from Great Britain and the United States in the nineteenth century does not support the idea that legislation and regulation can substantially reduce"}

In her essay, Anne Case explains why these critical questions are much more difficult to answer than one would think, and how a new kind of empirical studies, based on explicitly randomized or “natural” experiments, is overcoming these difficulties In every country there are strong correlations between a person’s education, earnings, health, and, for women, lowered fertility Isolating a causal effect of education is very difficult, however, since there is no doubt that there are also reverse channels of causality healthier children, for example, are better able to study Part of the correlation also comes from unobservable factors that affect both education and income For example, genetically transmitted talents and social connections that children get from their parents raise a child’s income both directly and through increased education Proper inference of causation requires that we find some variation in educational investment that has no direct connection with income, health, or fertility Case’s essay discusses a number of recent studies that have creatively exploited specific institutional changes which led to large shifts in educational investment without changing anything else A first example arises from changes in compulsory schooling laws implemented by various U S states at different times in the early twentieth century Linking the resulting exogenous variations in completed education to later mortality outcomes, Lleras-Muney finds a significant effect of education on longevity A second example is the work of Duflo, who evaluates the effects of a massive program of building primary schools by the Indonesian government in the early 1970s Linking the variations in educational achievement attributable to children’s different exposures to the program with their earnings two decades later, she estimates a substantial return, on the order of 10% per year of additional primary schooling In the second part of her essay, Case turns to the question of which inputs into education (e g , smaller classes, better-trained teachers, books, computers, etc ) yield the higher returns Here again she argues forcefully for being very careful about causally interpreting correlations She points out that if educators and administrators are pursuing any kind of systematic objective (whether efficiency related, equity related, or both) in allocating inputs across students, classes, or schools, those who access certain inputs will be different from those who do not For instance, administrators may group more talented and less disruptive students into larger classes, generating a reverse correlation between class size and achievement Alternatively, these groups may be assigned better teachers, which will cause the contribution of teacher quality to educational performance to be overstated Case reports on studies that exploit discontinuities in the rules governing class size in Israel and plausibly exogenous variations in centrally allocated inputs across Black schools in South Africa during apartheid to circumvent these problems and clearly establish the existence of substantial returns to class size reductions The best kind of data, however, comes from true randomized experiments, where the level and nature of the interventions"}

The example of schools, discussed by Besley and Ghatak, illustrates some of the issues involved On one hand, there is evidence from the United States suggesting that competition from private (Catholic) schools may improve the performance of public schools in the same city On the other hand, the effects of school voucher schemes are still vigorously debated by empirical researchers A large-scale study of vouchers in Chile, for instance, suggests that they mostly led to increased creamskimming and socioeconomic stratification with academic losses"}

To resolve these problems, a different innovation is needed, one that allows the advantages of community monitoring and collection to be combined with the knowhow and scale of a large insurance company This is what microinsurance, the insurance side of microfinance, is meant to do Morduch’s essay describes a number of important recent attempts in this direction, such as the development of rainfall insurance in Morocco Nevertheless, he argues that these problems are nowhere near being solved entirely Often, one solution creates new problems For instance, rainfall insurance designed to protect the incomes of farmers pushes up grain prices in a drought, which ends up hurting the rural landless who are net buyers rather than sellers of grain The next essay, by Robert Townsend, evaluates microfinance from a different angle, asking what it has delivered rather than what it can deliver His focus is on villages in Thailand, where financial markets generally work very imperfectly the poorest cannot borrow at all, and even those who can, typically need to put up collateral worth many times the loan they are getting Access to both formal and informal finance did improve considerably over the two decades between the mid1970s and mid-1990s, the period covered by his study Based on the observed correlations between credit, investment, and consumption, and a model that allows him to predict changes in people’s decisions, Townsend tries to evaluate the effects of this expansion He recognizes that this is a complicated exercise involving large amounts of guesswork, and therefore devotes a substantial part of his essay to explaining the underlying methodology and assumptions With all the resulting caveats, his results suggest that some forms of microlending are much more effective than others In particular, cash loans are much more valuable than loans in kind, and financial institutions that also provide savings services and training achieve the best outcomes His estimates suggest that having the best institutions may raise the growth rate of incomes in the village by as much as 5–6% per annum This kind of result is of course part of the reason why microfinance has generated so much excitement in the development community But it also underscores the importance of getting microfinance right, and the need for careful evaluations of what works and what does not, and being open to further innovations NEW WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT POVERTY Modern development economics grew in part out of resisting culturalist explanations of underdevelopment As evidenced by the essays by Schultz, Eswaran, Laffont, and Miguel in the first section of this book, the resistance still continues This is not always how it"}

Is poverty the same as hunger? What is the relationship between economic growth and poverty reduction? How will we know whether the first Millennium Development Goal has been met, or whether world poverty is falling at all? These are some of the questions that I address in this essay LOCAL AND NATIONAL POVERTY Everyone has some idea what poverty is, and most people have little difficulty answering the question “Do you consider yourself poor?,” although some people need a moment or two to think about it Nor do people find it hard to answer the same question about their neighbors or other people they know Yet these simple ideas turn out to be hard to extend to countries, and harder still to the world as a whole A participatory rural assessment, usually known by its acronym PRA, is a procedure often used by researchers and by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) working in villages in poor countries The researchers sit with the villagers at the local gathering place and find out about the village, mapping its houses, the school, the water supply, its agricultural activities, and who lives where It is common to ask the villagers to say who is well off, who is not so well off, and who is poor, and in most cases, villagers have no difficulty in making the identification No doubt there are some mistakes, and some people conceal some assets from their neighbors, but the results usually make sense The poor are often people who cannot work because they are ill or suffer from a long-term disability or are elderly There are also poor and vulnerable groups in specific locations, such as Indian widows who are unfortunate enough not to have sons to support them Such information can sometimes be used as part of poverty relief efforts In India, one scheme, the Antyodaya (Last Man First) food program, relies on local councils to identify the very poorest of rural households, who receive subsidized food"}

One way is to pose the question formally, in terms of the cost of subsistence Given all the foods in the market, as well as the calorie content and prices of each, what is the smallest amount of money that is needed to buy a bundle containing 2,000 calories? This solution of this problem played a role in the development of the mathematical technique of linear programming But when George Stigler first worked out the answer in 1945, he discovered a diet that was monotonous and uninteresting and that no one could reasonably be expected to eat (Animal feed is another matter, and linear programming is often used to set cost-effective diets for animals in feedlots ) Such a mathematical solution takes no account of the fact that people care about other things than just nutrients, including variety and flavor, and that what people want to eat is affected by their preferences and by the society in which they live To escape Stigler’s conclusion, calories can be converted into money by looking at what people actually spend and finding the income (or total expenditure) level at which, on average, people get 2,000 calories This can be done by plotting what is called the “calorie Engel curve,” a graph with income or total expenditure along the horizontal axis and the average calories of households at that income or expenditure level on the vertical axis The 2,000 calorie point on the vertical axis is then traced to the corresponding point on the horizontal axis, which becomes the income or expenditure poverty line People living in households with less than this amount are classified as poor and people with more as nonpoor There are variants of the calorie method In the United States, the poverty line was set by starting not"}

Even if we could set the poverty line precisely, and even if we could precisely measure each person’s income, neither of which conditions is close to being met, it makes no sense to treat such similar people so differently There is another good argument for not doing so A government that cares not at all about poverty but is being held to a poverty reduction standard, or is keen to be seen to be reducing poverty, could do so by giving small amounts of money to those just below the line, just enough to lift them out of poverty This money could even come from the very poor—once someone is poor, taking money away from him or her does nothing to add to the poverty count This tactic is open to any government whose poverty record is judged by the fraction of people below the poverty line It is sometimes argued that Mr Micawber was right after all, and that, if we think about it hard enough and do the supporting research, we will find some income level, or perhaps some combination of income and other things—an index of well-being— where there is a real observable jump in behavior For example, for children at school, having a pair of shoes might make the difference between being accepted or being treated as a pariah, just as the possession of a particular brand of sneaker might have a similar effect in a better-off country Yet decades of research into people’s spending patterns and income levels has always failed to find any clear discontinuity in the data, a point at which behavior suddenly changes that we might use as the cutoff for a poverty line The Micawber problem can be remedied by going beyond a count of the poor and taking note of the degree of poverty The head count ratio is the most familiar measure of poverty and is defined as the fraction of the population in poverty We can add to this measure information about the average incomes (or expenditures) of the poor A standard way of doing so is to compute the fraction by which each poor person is short of the poverty line, so that someone at half the poverty line would have a value of 0 5, while someone with nothing would have a value of 1 0 The poverty gap measure of poverty is then obtained by multiplying the head count ratio by the average value of this fractional shortfall among the poor Someone just below the line now counts for less than someone a long way below it, and our malevolent government can no longer cook its books by taking money from the poorest and giving it to those just below the line In practice,"}

No It is true there is a correlation between geography and prosperity, that is, a simple statistical association But statistical association does not prove causation Most important, there are often omitted factors driving the associations we observe in the data Consider an example from the history of malaria, the quintessential tropical disease, to illustrate this point In the nineteenth century doctors did not understand what caused malaria To make progress toward protecting European troops stationed in the tropics, they developed an “empirical theory” of malaria by observing that people who lived or traveled close to swamps caught malaria In other words, they turned the association between the incidence of malaria and the presence of swamps into a causal relationship that the incidence of malaria was caused by swamps—and elaborated on this theory by arguing that malaria was transmitted by mists, bad airs, and"}

Did places that were rich before colonization remain rich, as suggested by the geography hypothesis? Or was there a systematic change in economic fortunes associated with the changes in institutions? The historical evidence shows no evidence of the persistence suggested by the geography hypothesis On the contrary, there is a remarkable reversal of fortune in economic prosperity Societies—such as the Mughals in India and the Aztecs and the Incas in the Americas—that were among the richest civilizations in 1500 are among the poorer societies of today In contrast, countries occupying"}

The answer is yes In fact, once we look at the variation in colonization strategies, we see that the reversal of fortune is exactly what the institutions hypothesis predicts European colonialism made Europeans the politically powerful group with the capability to influence institutions more than any indigenous group was able to at the time As suggested by our discussion above, we expect Europeans to have done so not according to the interest of the society as a whole, but in order to maximize their benefits And this is exactly what the historical evidence suggests happened In places where Europeans did not settle, and thus did not care much about aggregate output or welfare in places where there was a large population to be coerced and employed cheaply in mines or in agriculture, or simply taxed in places where there was a lot to be extracted, Europeans pursued the strategy of setting up extractive institutions In those colonies, there were no constraints on the power of the elites (i e , the Europeans and their allies), and no civil or property rights for the majority of the population in fact, many of them were forced laborers or slaves Contrasting with this pattern, in other colonies Europeans settled in large numbers and developed the laws and institutions of the society to ensure that they themselves were protected in both their political and their economic lives In these settler colonies, the institutions were therefore much more conducive to investment and economic growth This discussion also suggests that Europeans were more likely to invest in the development of institutions of private property in areas that were sparsely settled and previously relatively poor And this is what the data show The relatively densely settled and highly urbanized colonies ended up with extractive institutions, while sparsely settled and nonurbanized areas received an influx of European migrants and developed institutions protecting property rights and constraining elites European colonialism therefore led to an institutional reversal, in the sense that the richer places ended up with worse institutions To be fair, it is possible the Europeans did not actively introduce extractive institutions in many of these places The structures of"}

Figure 2 5 Perceived Protection against Expropriation Risk, 1985–1995 versus Log Settler Mortality Figure 2 6 Log Income per Capita in 1995 versus Log Settler Mortality In Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001), we document that this pattern reflects neither the current prevalence of malaria, nor current general health conditions, nor various geographic factors ranging from temperature to humidity, from natural resources to soil quality 8 Instead, we argue that the association shown in Figure 2 6 works through the effect of these mortality rates on European settlement and institutional development In places where they faced high mortality rates, Europeans did not settle and typically introduced extractive institutions Extractive institutions have a lot of staying power for example, groups who benefit from using the power of the state to expropriate others will resist and attempt to block any move toward better institutions As a result, in many cases extractive institutions have persisted from colonial times to today and still adversely affect economic growth The idea that Figure 2 6 captures the effect of European settler mortality rates working via institutional development, not the direct effect of these diseases, is also supported by the mortality rates of indigenous peoples in these areas While Europeans faced very high death rates, the indigenous population had mortality rates similar to those of Europeans in their home countries For example, the annual mortality rates of native troops serving in Bengal and Madras were respectively 11 and 13 in 1,000, similar to—in fact, lower than—the annual mortality rate of British troops serving in Britain, which was approximately 15 in 1,000 In contrast, the death rates of British troops serving in these colonies were much higher because of their lack of immunity to local disease For example, death rates in Bengal and Madras for British troops were between 70 and 170 in 1,000 That the relationship in Figure 2 6 does not reflect the direct effect of the disease environment is also consistent with the fact that using only information about the prevalence of yellow fever leads to similar results 9 Since yellow fever is largely eradicated today, this is unlikely to reflect the direct effect of yellow fever The advantage of exploiting this source of variation in institutions is that we can both get a rough sense of how important institutions are in explaining current differences in economic performance, and also test for possible direct effects of various geographic characteristics"}

Yes and no There is no evidence that geography plays a major (quantitatively large) direct role in the very large differences in income per capita and growth potential of countries today But this does not mean that geography is unimportant It is important in at least four major ways First, geography and diseases almost surely matter for economic outcomes There can be no agriculture at the poles, and it is a truism that healthy individuals will be more productive and motivated in their work, in school, and in their lives The statement here is that the effects of geography and diseases are not a major factor in explaining the tremendous cross-country differences in prosperity—not that geography and diseases have no economic effects at all 11 Second, because geography is not at the root of the tremendous differences in economic prosperity today does not mean that it was unimportant in history It is quite possible that geographic differences shaped the reasons why some areas were richer than others more than 500 years ago This must be the primary candidate for explaining why tropical areas among the colonies were more prosperous than temperate ones in 1500 Going even farther back, geographic characteristics must have been important in determining where settled agriculture developed and where humans migrated Third,"}

It is important to understand the social and human costs of disease and act upon them Many scholars, journalists, and commentators argue that the Western world should invest in the health of lessdeveloped populations and try to reduce mortality and morbidity in these areas because of the economic benefits that these investments will create Our perspective is that we should undertake such investments on humanitarian and social grounds After all, we have as much reason to care about the lives of people as about their incomes NOTES 1 Due to space constraints, in this essay we cannot do full justice to the range of geography hypotheses See Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2002) for more on these views 2 See North (1981), Bates (1981), and Olson (1982) for a general discussion Acemoglu and Robinson (2000, 2002) for why elites may block beneficial institutional change because they fear losing their politically privileged position and Acemoglu (2003) for problems associated with the credibility of striking deals between powerful groups and the rest of the society so as to compensate the latter after institutional changes take place 3 See, for example, Bloch (1967) or White (1962) 4 Again, see Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2002) for more discussion 5 Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2002) show that the reversal of fortune can be statistically accounted for by the differences in institutions during or after colonial times, further supporting the conclusion in this paragraph 6 See, for example, Frank (1978) or Wallerstein (1974–1980) 7 See Curtin (1989) 8 Controlling for these geographic characteristics has little effect on the relationship of interest, partly because prevalence of malaria and yellow fever is not related to any simple geographic characteristics 9 See Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001) 10 See Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001) see also Easterly and Levine (2003) 11 Existing evidence from microdata on the effect of health on individual economic outcomes indicates significant effects, which are quantitatively at least one order of magnitude smaller than cross-country differences in income per capita, consistent with this conclusion See, for example, the survey in Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2003) 12 Similarly, Engerman and Sokoloff (1997) have emphasized"}

In other words, the history of European colonization provides scholars with a rich supply of evidence, or a laboratory, that can be used to study economic performance and the evolution of institutions over the long run Because some of the characteristics of the colonies were in place at or near the time of settlement, and thus can reasonably be treated as exogenous, many economists have been hopeful that the data generated by their later development can be used to get at causal relationships or mechanisms Inequality is one of the key variables that emerge from these studies as of great consequence to long-run paths of development Moreover, not only does extreme inequality seem to have had a profound influence on societies so afflicted, but the dynamics of European settlement generated many colonies in that condition Several research teams have arrived at similar conclusions, but perhaps the most direct examination of the impact of inequality has been the work we have done on the economies of the Americas Our investigation began with a question Why was it that for at least 250 years after the Europeans arrived to colonize the so-called New World, most observers regarded the English, French, Dutch, and Spanish settlements on the northern part of the North American continent as relative backwaters with limited economic prospects, and that the flows of resources to the Americas mirrored that view? The simple answer is that per capita incomes, especially for those of European descent, were higher in at least parts of the Caribbean and South America than they were in the colonies that were to become the United States and Canada well into the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries Looking back from the vantage point of the early twenty-first century, however, it is clear that the real puzzle is why the first colonies established by Europeans in the Americas were those that fell behind—and, conversely, why the societies populated by those who came later and had to settle in areas considered less favorable have proved more successful economically over the long run A traditional and popular explanation for these intriguing patterns credits the success of the North American economies to the superiority of English institutional heritage, or to the better fit of Protestant beliefs with market institutions 5 However, proponents of this interpretation generally neglect the implications of the fact that different British colonies in the New World evolved quite distinct societies and sets of economic institutions, despite beginning with roughly the same legal and cultural background and drawing immigrants from similar places and economic classes British Guiana (now Guyana), Jamaica, and British Honduras (now Belize) are among the many whose records of development stand in stark contrast with those of the United States and Canada, but resemble those of neighboring societies of different national heritages Impressed with how the evidence seemed inconsistent with the notions that British heritage or Protestantism was the key factor, we instead"}
{"id": 251, "text": "seemed inconsistent with the notions that British heritage or Protestantism was the key factor, we instead offered an alternative explanation of the divergent paths of development among the societies of the Americas We highlighted how the great majority of European colonies in the New World came to be characterized early in their histories, primarily because of their factor endowments, by extreme inequality in the distributions of wealth, human capital, and political influence We argued, moreover, that these initial differences in inequality were of major import, because societies that began with great inequality tended, as compared with the small number—including those that came to make up the United States and Canada—that began with relative equality and homogeneity of the population, to evolve institutions that contributed to the persistence of substantial inequality and generally poor records of development over the long run 6 What led to such substantial differences in inequality across colonies? Briefly put, extreme inequality arose in the colonies of the Caribbean and in Brazil because their soils and climates gave them a comparative advantage in growing sugar and other lucrative crops that were produced at lowest cost during the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries on very large slave plantations These colonies soon specialized heavily in their comparative advantage, and with the consequent importation of enormous numbers of slaves, their populations came to be composed of a small elite of European descent and a dominant share of the population (generally 85% or more) consisting of black slaves or (later) nonwhite freedmen and their descendants Extreme inequality in wealth and human capital came to characterize much of Spanish America as well The inequality here arose from the endowment of large populations of Native Americans and from the Spanish practices (which were influenced by preexisting Native American organizations in Mexico and Peru) of awarding claims on land, native labor, and rich mineral resources to members of the elite (whose number was limited by restrictive immigration policies) However, some societies, such as Argentina, Uruguay, and Costa Rica, were less affected In contrast, the societies of the northern part of North America developed with relative equality and population homogeneity because there were relatively few Native Americans on the East Coast where the colonies were established, and the climates and soils favored a regime of mixed farming centered on grains and livestock that exhibited quite limited economies of scale in production Although the Americas provide a particularly well-suited context for the study of the impact of inequality on institutional and economic development, the patterns in that part of the world may well have important implications for the experience of societies established as European colonies elsewhere With the exceptions of Australia and New Zealand, European settlements in other parts of the world were not based upon large numbers of European settlers who became the key productive laborers, but upon small numbers who remained on the perimeter of the country and exercised control through military power or political arrangements with the local rulers For example, the Portuguese, Dutch, British, and French sailed around the Cape of Good Hope, at"}

Next, one could argue that what has been happening since the 1970s in developed countries is just a remake of the previous inverse-U curve a new industrial revolution has taken place, thereby leading to rising inequality, and inequality will decline again at some point, as more and more workers benefit from the new innovations In a sense, Kuznets’s theory can be viewed as a sophisticated formulation of the standard, trickle-down view of development innovations first benefit a few individuals and eventually trickle down to the mass of the people Back in the 1950s, Kuznets stressed the rural/urban dimension of the process in his view, development meant moving from a low-income, rural, agricultural sector to a highincome, urban, industrialized sector But the same logic can obviously be applied to other two-sector models, such as a model with an “old economy” sector and a “new economy,” IT-intensive sector So the more general question I want to ask is the following Looking at the most recent trends in both rich and poor countries, what evidence do we have in favor of this “technical change” view of inequality dynamics, whereby waves of technological innovations generate waves of inverse-U curves? The rest of this essay is organized as follows In the second section, I focus upon the inequality decline that took place in the West during the first half of the twentieth century I argue that recent historical research is rather damaging for Kuznets’s interpretation the reasons why inequality declined in rich countries seem to be due to very specific shocks and circumstances that do not have much to do with the migration process described by Kuznets and that are very unlikely to occur again in today’s poor countries (one hopes) In the third section, I take a broader perspective on the technical change view of inequality dynamics, drawing both from historical experience and from more recent trends I argue that this view has proven to be excessively naïve to properly account for the observed facts and that country-specific institutions often play a role that is at least as important as technological waves Although this essay focuses primarily on the impact of development on distribution (in the Kuznets tradition), I will occasionally refer to the reverse causality, from distribution to growth (an issue that has attracted a lot of attention since the mid1990s WHY DID INEQUALITY DECLINE IN THE WEST? At the time Kuznets gave his presidential address to the 1954 American Economic Association Annual Congress in Detroit, there were few data on distribution For the most part, the address (which was to become his famous 1955 article) relied on the 1913–1948 series on U S top income shares that Kuznets had just constructed and published in a voluminous and path-breaking book (Kuznets 1953) Although income distribution had played a central role in economic thinking at least since the time of Ricardo and Marx, this was the very first time that an economist was able to produce a homogeneous distribution series covering a reasonably"}

Well, probably because the demand for new skills kept increasing, and the supply of new skills was just enough to prevent wage dispersion from rising Had the schooling institutions managed to raise the supply of skilled workers at a faster pace, the outcome might have been different Another leading example is the rise of wage dispersion that has occurred in the United States since the 1970s According to one popular theory, this dramatic evolution is simply due to skill-biased technical change However, a number of economists have challenged this explanation For instance, it has been noted that education-related wage gaps rose for younger workers, but not for older workers What this suggests is that the slowdown in the rate of growth of educational attainment (number of college graduates, etc ) for the younger cohorts has been a key driving force behind the observed changes 8 Whether or not wage dispersion will decline in the future probably depends a lot on the ability of educational institutions to deliver higher growth rates of skill supply It has also been noted that inequality between bottom wages and the middle ranks rose only during the 1980s and then stabilized during the 1990s, despite continuing advances in computer technology This suggests that changes in the minimum wage (rather than market forces) played the dominant role (the minimum wage fell in the 1980s, and stabilized in the 1990s) 9 Minimum wage and other labor market institutions can in turn have an impact on the direction of technical change for instance, more wage compression can encourage more investment in technologies increasing the productivity of less-skilled workers 10 There are many other institutions that play a key role in inequality dynamics For instance, it is very hard to explain the dramatic rise of very top wages in the United States (which accounts for a disproportionate share of the rise of top wage shares observed since the 1970s) on the basis of technical change alone Between 1970 and 2000, the average real compensation of the top 100 CEOs was multiplied by a factor of more than 30, while the average wage in the U S economy increased by about 10% (see Figure 4 2) There is a lot of evidence suggesting that such a phenomenal rise of executive compensation has more to do with bad governance and lack of control (perhaps due to"}
{"id": 274, "text": "executive compensation has more to do with bad governance and lack of control (perhaps due to very dispersed capital ownership) than with the rise of CEO efficiency and productivity 11 Investors have recently started to realize that CEO compensation has gone out of control, but there is a long way to go before we come back to a more reasonable state of affairs It is also quite likely that changing social norms and attitudes toward inequality have played an important role in this evolution Short of that, it’s difficult to understand why very top wages increased so much in the United States and not in Europe The idea that social norms are an important factor in setting pay is particularly plausible for very top wages, given that it is virtually impossible for board members (as well as for economists) to measure precisely the productivity of a CEO Finally, government institutions and changing social norms can also be relevant for the analysis of rising income inequality in a number of LDCs For instance, it is unclear whether one can account for the huge rise of very top incomes (and particularly top wages) observed in a country such as India during the 1990s on the basis of demand and supply alone (see Figure 4 3) There is today in many parts of the world a wider acceptance of inequality than was the case a few decades ago, and this probably has a strong impact on actual inequality Whether or not this will remain so in the near future is very much an open issue at this stage Figure 4 2 CEO Pay versus Average Wage Income in the US, 1970–2000 Figure 4 3 The Top 1% Income Share in India, 1922–2000 CONCLUDING COMMENTS In this essay, I have attempted to provide a critical overview of recent research on the interplay between economic development and economic inequality There are a number of important conclusions that emerge First, the reasons why inequality declined in industrialized countries during the first half of the twentieth century do not have much to do with the optimistic trickledown process advocated by Kuznets in the 1950s The compression of income distribution that took place during the 1914–1945 period was due, for the most part, to very specific capital shocks and circumstances that are very unlikely to happen again Progressive income and estate taxation probably explains to a large extent why capital concentration did not return to the very high levels observed before the shocks The historical experience of developed countries also shows that high wealth inequality is not necessary for growth, and that it can even be harmful Next, there are myriad country-specific institutions (from educational and labor market institutions to corporate governance and social norms) that play a key role in shaping the interplay between development and inequality Rising dispersion of income is not the mechanical and largely unavoidable consequence of technical change Nor is the trend going to reverse in a spontaneous fashion Inequality dynamics depend primarily on the policies and institutions adopted by governments and societies as a"}

Here, the now well-established answer is that it was the green revolution, and the resulting boost to productivity in agriculture, that made it happen 1 That is, the diffusion of a fundamental innovation to the entire agricultural sector, and its spillovers to the urban sector, via its effects on food prices and wages 2 Somewhat surprisingly, this declining poverty trend was sustained in the 1980s and 1990s, even though the productivity impact of the green revolution had been largely exhausted In their paper “Poverty and Inequality in India,” Angus Deaton and Jean Drèze (2002) analyze the evolutions of inequality and poverty in India over the past decades They employ survey data provided by three quinquennial rounds of questionnaires (conducted over the time intervals 1987–1988, 1993–1994, and 1999–2000) on households’ consumption of a given set of durable and nondurable goods This information in turn is used to evaluate the number of individuals who lie below the poverty line divided by the total population, or the “head-count ratio ” The first main finding reported by Deaton and Drèze (see Table 5 1) is that even after one adjusts for changes in the design of questionnaires from one round to the next (official methodology), or for changes in price indexes over time (adjusted methodology), poverty in both rural and urban areas has substantially declined since the 1980s Deaton and Drèze also find the same pattern when using poverty gap or agricultural wage measures instead of the head count A second finding is that consumption inequality across individual households increased between the period 1993–1994 and the period 1999–2000, which in turn is consistent with Abhijit Banerjee and Thomas Piketty’s (2001) finding of a substantial increase in income inequality among the highest income earners Moreover, such findings are consistent with the result presented in the 2004 article by Philippe Aghion, Robin Burgess, Stephen Redding, and Fabrizio Zilibotti (hereafter referred to as “ABRZ”)"}

Here, the most informative study is by Dani Rodrik and Arvind Subramanian (2004), who find (see Table 5 2) that after a prolonged stagnation, all productivity variables—real per capita GDP, real GDP per worker, and TFP—have taken off since the early 1980s and have kept growing at a sustained high rate ever since Thus, a very first look at the period since the 1960s suggests that the green revolution, and then the advent of sustained productivity growth in the manufacturing sector, explain this poverty alleviation phenomenon to a large extent In both instances, technology and entrepreneurship in the rural and in the urban sectors have played a key role NEW GROWTH THEORY IN A NUTSHELL Three main ideas underlie the new theories of endogenous technical pro-gress 3 First, productivity growth is driven primarily by the rate of technological innovations, in the form of new products, new processes, and new ways of organizing production Second, most innovations are the result of entrepreneurial activities or investments, such as research and development investments, which involve risky experimentation and learning Third, the incentive to engage in innovative investments is itself affected by the economic environment Here are five prime examples of institutions and/or policies that affect long-run productivity growth through their impact on entrepreneurs’ incentives, or through their ability to make innovative investments 1 An effective education system will have a positive effect on long-run productivity growth, both by increasing the efficiency of innovation technologies and investments (both are highly skill intensive) and by reducing the cost of skilled labor, which in turn increases the profits that accrue to successful innovators As shown by Benhabib and Spiegel (1994) and Krueger and Lindhal (2001), a higher stock of human capital increases countries’ ability both to innovate at the frontier and to imitate more advanced technologies 4 Table 5 2 Average Growth Rates in India (Percentage) 2 A legal environment that allows entrepreneurs to appropriate a significant fraction of the revenues generated by their innovative investments In particular, better protection of (intellectual) property rights or a labor market that is not too unfavorable to employers, will enhance the expected profits from innovation and thereby encourage innovative investments and productivity growth That better property rights protection is growth-enhancing has been widely established since the nineteenth century, and it comes out very clearly in the recent work on the economics of institutions (e g , see La Porta et al 1998 Hall and Jones 1999 and Acemoglu et al 2001) The role of labor market regulations is equally important, as we show in ABRZ (2004) and report in the section “The Unequalizing Effects of the Indian Liberalization Experience” (below) 3 Macroeconomic stability also tends to foster long-term productivity growth 5 it reduces interest rates and therefore increases the present"}

Or did growth over the whole period result instead from other changes that occurred in 1980 or before, and would have much less to do with what new growth theories suggest? In fact, Rodrik and Subramanian (2002) identify two phases in the Indian growth experience since the 1980s there is first what they call the phase of “pro-business” reforms, starting in 1980 with the return of Indira Gandhi and the subsequent rise of Rajiv Gandhi These two leaders sent a clear signal to the enterprise sector that the Congress Party and the Indian government would abandon its previous pro-socialism and pro-poor rhetoric and favor the expansion of existing private companies through pro-business measures such as the easing of restrictions on capacity expansion, the removal of price controls, and the reduction of corporate taxes Though this reform package did not emphasize trade or entry liberalization, if we believe the new growth approach outlined above, all these measures should be expected to foster productivity growth by increasing incumbent entrepreneurs’ ability to appropriate the rents from their innovative investments And indeed, this policy shift by the Indian government was followed by a growth acceleration that in turn was due primarily to a continuous increase in productivity and, to a lesser extent, to factor accumulation Rodrik and Subramanian demonstrate that the sequencing of the policy change and the growth takeoff was not spurious, but reflected a causal relationship, in two ways (1) the growth upsurge was more pronounced in Indian states where members of the local government"}
{"id": 281, "text": "(1) the growth upsurge was more pronounced in Indian states where members of the local government belonged to (or were allied with) the ruling Congress Party (2) there was a significant shift in private investment from the household to the manufacturing sector, which in turn reflected a positive reaction of the private sector to what it perceived as an improved investment climate As explained above, it was not until 1991 that markets and trade were truly liberalized, and here the second phase of the Indian growth experience started As argued in the previous section, higher competition and entry should be expected to further encourage innovative investments aimed at escaping them, which in turn would explain why growth continued at the same rate during the 1990s in spite of the balance-of-trade crisis However, in contrast with the 1980s, poverty reduction in the 1990s appears to have slowed down, and poverty levels even fluctuated in the early 1990s As we shall argue in the next section, such fluctuations might be explained by the fact that trade liberalization entails winners and losers, both within and across sectors THE UNEQUALIZING EFFECTS OF THE INDIAN LIBERALIZATION EXPERIENCE ABRZ (2004) analyze the impact of liberalization on the performance of registered manufacturing firms 9 They run panel regressions of performance measures such as TFP growth or profitability in a particular industry in a particular state at a particular time They regress these performance measures over (1) the prereform proximity of the state industry to the Indian technological frontier (defined as labor productivity in the three-digit state industry in 1990 divided by labor productivity in the most productive three-digit state industry in that year) (2) a dummy variable that captures the liberalization reform and is equal to zero before 1991 and to 1 thereafter (3) labor market institutions at the state level, and in particular the extent to which labor regulations in the state are more “pro-employer” or more “pro-employee” relative to other states To capture state-level institutions, ABRZ follow Besley and Burgess (2003), who use the number and direction (pro-employer or pro-employee) of the state-level amendments to the 1947 Industrial Disputes Act to measure the extent to which the labor regulations are more pro-employer or more pro-employees in the states of India They look at both whether the direction of regulatory change over the 1980–1997 period affected industry performance and whether prereform labor market institutions affected postreform performance ABRZ also control for state industry and year fixed effects, and the standard errors are adjusted for clustering by state to deal with problems of serial correlation The key empirical results from ABRZ (2004) can be summarized as follows TFP, investment, and profitability respond more positively to the liberalization reform in industries that are initially closer to the technological frontier Moreover, technological progress and the growth in profitability are slower in industries located in more pro-employee states this is fully consistent with the view, put forward by new growth theories, that the institutional environment in which firms operate affects their investment incentives and, subsequently, their productivity growth performance Finally, liberalization increases"}

In our discussion so far we have tried to argue that poverty alleviation and economic development should be addressed from a macro-growth perspective as well as from a pure micro-household viewpoint However, someone critical of our way of thinking would bring up the example of Latin American countries where poverty indicators have deteriorated over the past decades even though (or perhaps because) these countries implemented a “Washington Consensus” type of package (price and trade liberalization, privatization, and stabilization) Interestingly, neither poverty nor growth indicators have improved in those countries during the recent period, so that Latin America is not a counterexample to begin with Yet it is worth understanding why Latin American countries are not growing Part of a possible answer to this question relies on the combination of three elements inequality, education, and trade First is inequality, which is higher in Latin America than in Asia 10 As suggested by Alesina and Rodrik (1994) and Benabou (1996), too much inequality tends to be detrimental to growth, especially in less developed countries Second is education, which is far more widespread in East Asian countries such as Korea and Hong Kong than in Latin America Third is trade East Asian countries, and more recently China, have followed more aggressive export promotion strategies combined with high investments of physical and human capital Another part of the answer to the above question thus may lie in differences in growth strategies pursued by different countries and regions through their export promotion policies, Asian countries have targeted their efforts on imitating the most innovative sectors in developed countries, whereas Latin American countries have followed import substitution policies driven by the local market and by a static view of comparative advantage The reasons why these growth-enhancing"}

It seems natural and tempting to try to define a globalized world as one where there is unrestricted flow of commodities and ideas across national boundaries, and globalization as the process of approaching that ideal This would mean, however, that Canada would have to move toward U S gun laws and Dutch drug laws, which seems unfair Perhaps we could allow countries to have their own laws about who can consume what (but not where it was made) The bigger problem, of course, is what to do with all the people from India who want to move across the U S boundary Clearly, not even the most enthusiastic globalizer is talking about the unregulated movement of people Unrestricted migration is not an option, we are told, because of its potential for enormous displacement and damage to the social fabric But is there not damage to the social fabric when cotton farmers in India end their lives because, with imports so much cheaper, no one wants their cotton anymore? In the first half of 2004, there were over 300 reported farmer suicides in the state of Andhra Pradesh alone, many of them by drinking the very pesticides that they had bought to protect their cotton crop 1 The sad truth is that we have been taught to privilege the costs of migration by the sheer virulence of the racist reaction that it has sometimes engendered The victims of freer trade are handicapped by their inability to effectively invoke the irresistible rhetoric of blood and honor There are, of course, many others who have reason to be grateful for what globalization has done for them And this includes not only the millionaires in Bangalore and Beijing, but also their chauffeurs and cleaning ladies The starvation of the cotton farmer ought to be weighed against the potential starvation of his sister, who, after being abandoned by her husband, found a bearable living cleaning dishes in the homes of the software rich Indeed, as David Ricardo explained almost exactly two centuries ago, since trade allows the country to specialize in what it does best, total income ought to go up when a country opens itself to trade, implying that the income gains to the winners should be larger than the income losses suffered by the losers"}

There have been a number of in-depth studies of what happened when specific countries liberalized Adrian Wood studied the East Asian “tigers” and found that low-skilled workers did relatively well in Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan (but not in Hong Kong) in the decade that followed the lowering of trade barriers This is as one might have expected, given everything we have been told about how they grew rich by exporting labor-intensive goods Things started going wrong with the Mexican liberalization of 1985–1987 Over this two-year period, Mexico massively reduced both the coverage of its import quota regime and the average duty on imports Over the rest of the decade, bluecollar workers lost almost 15% of their wages while their white-collar counterparts gained in the same proportion, reversing the trend toward greater equality in the years leading up to the trade liberalization 9 Argentina showed a similar pattern trade barriers were massively lowered"}

If I am right in looking at the world in this way, where does it leave us? Relative to the benign vision of globalization offered by the Samuelson-Stolper Theorem, at least for the poor in poor countries, all this is obviously bad news, though recognizing the problem does help us control the damage It tells us, for one thing, that countries need to think hard about reputation There are a number of steps that a country can take to make reputation acquisition less of an issue More effective court systems make it easier to sue for damages if a supplier misbehaves, which encourages buyers to consider sellers who are yet to make a name for themselves Developing trade relations with other developing countries has a similar effect, because poorer buyers may be more willing to trade off quality for low prices It is perhaps no accident that Guido Porto found that Mercosur, which integrated the economies of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay into a single (almost) free trade zone, benefited the poor in Argentina A public scoring system for buyers and sellers, where buyers report their experiences with specific suppliers and vice versa (for example, on CNET com or Dealtime com), may be one way to speed the process of building up a reputation, simply by making it easier to identify malefactors We do, however, have to careful about the possibility of abuse here Sellers may try to blackmail buyers by threatening to give them a harsh report Creating an environment that is friendly toward multinational investors also helps, though most countries seem to trust domestic capitalists more than their foreign counterparts My sense is that this is largely unwarranted (though perhaps politically necessary) The prima facie evidence seems to be that within any sector multinationals pay higher wages to people with the same observable qualities, compared with domestic firms Indeed, the simple fact of being in the public eye probably makes them behave better Multinationals are useful because their reputations can intermediate between domestic sellers and foreign buyers, and also because they are better at negotiating with regulators in the north, who are often all too willing to protect domestic producers from cheaper imports, in the name of protecting the health of domestic consumers Much of what China now exports is produced by nameless"}

The conventional answer, at least among economists, is that trade is worth it as long as it makes the pie bigger If the income gains to those who gain from trade are larger than the losses to those who lose, we should be in favor of trade, because we could always redistribute the gains to make everyone better off On the other hand, if I am right in my diagnosis of what drives trade today, the losers will include large numbers of poor people in poor countries, and I very much doubt that they will all be compensated for their losses The problem is that targeted redistribution is never easy Identifying the losers is hard, taxing the winners is harder, and making sure that the money does not somehow get lost along the way is sometimes well nigh impossible The best way to make sure that no one loses from liberalization is almost surely not to do it On the other hand, I know of no example of a labor-abundant developing country that has had sustained growth without being outwardly oriented in some broad sense of the term The problem is that growing countries need technology and capital from abroad, and to pay for these imports and to take full advantage of what they are good at doing, they need markets abroad It is true that none of this directly requires being totally open to imports China, after all, is only starting to get there But it does require a credible commitment to remain open for the foreseeable future, to convince foreign investors that the country will earn enough foreign currency to repay what it is borrowing now And it requires being sufficiently open to imports from the north to keep the WTO happy, if for no other reason than keeping the markets in the north open to its exports In the end, the choice is between cutting oneself more"}

There is little evidence that poor, unskilled workers get lower wages (or fewer jobs) in the presence of those companies, compared with what they will get in their absence, other things remaining the same 4 Contrary to the impression created by the campaign in affluent countries against “sweatshops” run by multinational companies in poor countries, it can be pointed out that the poor are often banging at the gates of these sweatshops for a chance of entry, since these are far better than their current alternatives working in occupations with inferior work conditions or no employment at all This is not an argument against efforts to improve their work conditions (and certainly not in favor of the totally indefensible cases of forced labor or hazardous or unsafe work conditions) 5 But it does suggest that we should look at the reality of the severely limited opportunities faced by the poor and the unintended consequences of trying to restrict rich-country imports of “sweatshop” products because of the harm that may be caused to the displaced poor workers Of course, sometimes the large companies, instead of hiring labor themselves, outsource their activities to smaller firms and household enterprises, where the wages and overhead costs are lower, to the detriment of the formal sector employees But the net effect on the workers of the country should take into account the resultant improvement in wages and employment among the usually much poorer informal sector workers There are, however, three important reasons why opening the economy may worsen the conditions of workers One relates to the issue of mobility of workers or their ability to retool and relocate as the market conditions change This often depends on the state of available credit, information, social networks, and infrastructural facilities When the latter are absent or deficient, workers stuck in the declining sectors in an open economy get hurt A second reason has to do with the nature of technical change Since much technical change in rich countries is biased against the services of unskilled labor, transplantation of those new techniques by multinational companies into poor countries will cause employment and wages of unskilled labor to go down This has reportedly been the case, for example, with global tenders to construction companies, such as Bechtel or Mitsui, using laborsaving technology, which has rendered many construction workers unemployed in India The third reason has to do with collective bargaining Globalization often leads to a weakening of unions As foreign competition (or"}

Its allocation across the two sectors must be such that, at the incomes determined by the productivities of the inputs, the total amounts demanded of grain and textiles must equal the total amounts supplied We can now see why the percentage of the labor force in the agricultural sector of a poor country tends to be high Poor countries typically employ technologies that have low productivity As a result, almost all the resources of the economy are needed to produce the food requirements of the population Since whatever a closed economy consumes must be domestically produced, most of the labor force will be employed in agriculture In fact, at very low levels of technical efficiency, there may be no demand at all for textiles, and the entire labor force will be employed in agriculture Were such a country, in its zeal to emulate the developed countries, to attempt to jumpstart industry through state intervention, its attempt would end in failure Given the preferences for agricultural and"}

To answer this, suppose the economy’s population size and the supply of land are such that workers are consuming only grain, and landlords, being richer, are consuming both grain to satiation and textiles This is a realistic scenario in most developing countries Consider now the effect of technological change in industry, which enables each worker to produce more textiles What benefit, if any, will the workers receive from this? The productivity increase will lower the price of textiles, since each meter of textiles now requires less labor Workers, who are still not sated with grain, however, will not see any benefit from this price decline because they do not consume textiles But there is another avenue through which productivity improvements can impinge on well-being The wages of a worker may rise in purchasing power and enable her to buy more of the good she does consume, grain A more productive computer scientist, for example, earns a higher income that she can spend on goods other than computers Will a similar process operate here? No, and for the following reason Since, in this exercise, agricultural technology is not changing, the only way in which an agricultural (and, hence, industrial) worker’s wage rate will increase is if there is a migration of workers from agriculture to industry, leaving each agricultural worker more land to work with Were this to transpire, the total amount of food demanded would increase because workers would demand more grain while the landlords would demand the same amount as before Since there are now fewer agricultural workers, however, the supply of food will decrease This imbalance between the demand for and supply of grain would thwart the reallocation of labor to industry and prevent the wage rate from rising As a result, technical progress in industry would have no"}

It must import equipment and technology from developed countries if it wants to get the benefit of the technological progress that has taken place in the developed world But to import machinery, it must export something that it has an advantage in producing Typically, developing countries started their industrialization programs by exporting agricultural products or minerals For example, Japan’s initial exports were silk and bamboo products Taiwan’s were rice and sugar Malaysia’s were rubber and timber Even in Canada and the United States, the developmental process during their industrialization period was driven by the exports of staples such as wheat and beaver pelts As incomes rise all over the world, consumers’ preference for variety grows American and European consumers demand tropical fruits and vegetables and flowers A developing country with a productive and diversified agriculture is in a better position to take advantage of the technological progress and taste for variety in developed countries in order to initiate its own industrialization It should be noted that land-abundant countries such as the United States and Canada have been major food exporters in the world for a long time, and their comparative advantage in agriculture did not hamper their industrial growth In 1900, the proportion of the labor force in agriculture in these countries was 38 9% and 40 2%, respectively In 2000, these percentages had declined to 2 35% and 2 33%, respectively 3 How did this happen? Interestingly, it was growth in agricultural productivity that spawned and sustained industrialization in these countries It did so not only by generating agricultural exports that financed imports of machinery but also by generating linkages (spillovers) to other sectors When a vast majority of people live off agriculture, productivity growth in that sector raises incomes across the country, creating demand for industrial goods and helping the industrial sector achieve higher productivity through learning by doing What is implicitly assumed here is that the domestic industrial sector is protected from foreign competition until it can compete internationally 4 But even when no such protection is provided, industrialization can proceed gradually through growth linkages generated by a rise in agricultural incomes But in order to capture an essential aspect of these growth linkages to the two sectors we have been considering thus far, we need to add a third sector services 5 Indeed, the service sector comprises a significant proportion of labor employment even in developing countries Consumers as well as manufacturers demand services Examples are construction, transportation, insurance, credit, repair services, and refrigeration When agricultural productivity increases, consumers become richer and, apart from demanding industrial goods,"}

Is the direct association between fertility and poverty a basis for assessing the value of policy interventions that reduce fertility by subsidizing the voluntary adoption of birth control, or by imposing on parents a quota of children which penalizes excess births, such as implemented by China? It is hypothesized in this essay that some sources of family income encourage, and other sources discourage, fertility, because different sources of family income modify the economic opportunities parents must sacrifice to have another child, or the price of children in terms of parental time and market goods (Mincer 1963) For example, if an increment in family income is due to the rising value of women’s time, this source of income not only expands income opportunities of the family but also raises the effective price of children to the family Because it is empirically observed that higher values of women’s time are associated with lower levels of lifetime fertility, it is inferred that the price effect of women’s wages outweighs its income effect on fertility In contrast, if an increment in total family income is due to an increase in the returns to physical assets—financial assets, business assets, land, and natural resources, such as oil—these income sources add to family endowments while not necessarily affecting the relative opportunity cost of children to parents, in which case these income sources are expected to be associated with higher fertility, other things being"}

Interfamily welfare comparisons are often based on total expenditures per household in a given time period, such as a year To these market expenditures are then added home production, such as food that is produced and consumed in the home, and the imputed value of the consumer services that the household derives from its physical assets, predominantly in the form of owner-occupied housing and consumer durables This measure of total market-purchased and home-produced consumption is a widely used approximation for “permanent income,” or the present discounted value of average lifetime income opportunities, which is expected to influence the welfare of household members in the long run In contrast, “current income” is heavily affected by temporary fluctuations in income that households are expected to try to smooth over time into their current flow of consumption, by adding to or drawing down lifecycle savings (debt) Lifetime expected income is therefore the family resource variable that should be related to lifetime fertility, and this lifetime income constraint"}

{"id": 327, "text": "of children, including the pecuniary and psychic costs of using birth control The former genetic variation in fertility supply may be thought of as an unanticipated shock, whereas the latter behavioral variation in fertility demand could respond to parents’ perceived net benefit to having additional children, due either to observable factors (i e , prices, wages, or wealth) or to unobserved preferences (i e , tastes) of parents for children relative to other uses of their lifetime resources In the case of the genetic variation in fertility supply, this source of fertility is not expected to be correlated with the parents’ preferences or other unobserved behavioral constraints that could also modify family opportunities The genetic variation in fertility would therefore operate like a randomized experiment 6 If fertility is initially greater than parents want—in other words, if fecundity supply exceeds demand and birth control is costly—positive shocks of greater fertility associated with the arrival of twins, for example, would cause a welfare loss to parents 7 Families would then need to reduce and reallocate their expenditures in response to the unwanted fertility shock, shifting resources away from activities that substitute for children, and shifting resources into activities that complement their additional children 8 In contrast to this random genetic variation in fertility supply associated with the occurrence of twins, behavioral variation in fertility demand would be coordinated with other lifetime choices Consequently, the association observed between this behaviorally determined fertility and other forms of family consumption or labor supply is not prescribed by any general economic models of family choice, or readily interpreted as an indicator of the economic consequences of an additional child or sibling on an average parent or their child, respectively Whether fertility is a substitute or a complement for other family activities is an important distinction, which can be inferred by estimating how random shocks to fecundity affect other family choices Many models of family behavior assume that parents view the number of children they have (quantity) and the human capital they invest on average in each of their children (child quality) as substitutes (e g , Becker and Lewis 1974) If child quantity and quality are in fact substitutes, which empirical studies seem to confirm, then policies that raise the price of child quantity, such as those providing subsidies for birth control in a family-planning program, can be expected to help parents lower their fertility and to also foster their demand for more child quality Conversely, reducing the cost of child quality, which societies might do by subsidizing schooling for children, would lead parents to invest more in the schooling of their children and reduce their fertility (P Schultz 1981, 1997) Economic theories of the allocation of time and physical wealth of families among production and consumption activities suggest additional potential connections between the economic opportunities and constraints facing a couple and their demands for children Let me review a few of the predictions of the household demand framework, which help to interpret cross-sectional differences in fertility and changes over time 1 Increasing the productive value of"}

An important source of socially harmful fertility behavior is that while parents may altruistically consider the well-being of their children, they do not weight it equally with their own The mechanism, which was first proposed by Neher (1971), runs as follows Consider a poor country where children are the only assets An additional child imposes a cost on his parents when young When the child becomes an adult, he generates income in excess of his own consumption and is therefore a benefit to parents When the offspring reaches retirement, his consumption again exceeds income and needs to be subsidized by his children Thus an additional child is a net cost in childhood, a net benefit in adulthood, and again a net cost in retirement Parents incur the offspring’s cost in childhood and reap a benefit in adulthood But when their offspring again becomes a cost to society in retirement, the parents most likely will be dead It is therefore very likely that, in contemplating additional children, parents will either ignore or underestimate the cost that their offspring will impose on subsequent generations in their"}
{"id": 341, "text": "either ignore or underestimate the cost that their offspring will impose on subsequent generations in their retirement However, a benevolent social planner who weights future generations on par with the present one will not Thus, parents who are not completely altruistic will overestimate the benefits of children relative to the costs imposed on society As a result, privately chosen fertility levels will be too high relative to what is optimal for society ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND FERTILITY The role played by economic development in eliminating the wedge between private and social net benefits of children can now be readily seen With economic development come capital markets, offering various financial instruments for saving Along with these, private firms begin to offer pension plans and the government may offer social security These greatly reduce the need for parents to use children as vehicles for transferring income from their working life to retirement Thus, on these grounds alone, one would expect to see declining fertility with economic development There are other, equally compelling reasons why economic development results in fertility decline One of these has to do with the cost of the time of women Galor and Weil (1996) have proposed that as the capital stock of a nation increases, it impinges differentially on the wages of men and women While both engage in manual and nonmanual work, men have a relative advantage in manual work and women in nonmanual work If the increase in the capital stock (through saving) raises productivity of nonmanual labor more than it does of manual labor, the wage rate of women will rise faster than that of men As a couple becomes wealthier, it may want more children However, whether, and how many, children women bear depends on their wage rate relative to the couple’s income, since that determines the income women forgo by opting out of the labor market during and after pregnancy The relative increase in the wage rate of women leads to an increase in the participation of women in the labor market and a decline in fertility Given the arguments outlined above, the reader might infer that no special measures need be taken with regard to excessive population growth in developing countries if they are showing respectable economic growth The emergence of financial instruments for saving and the higher cost of children in terms of income forgone will reduce fertility In the words of a popular quip of the 1970s “Economic development is the best contraceptive ” Such an inference, however, would be premature The growth rates of the GDP of many developing countries with high population growth rates are very low Indeed, as we have seen, part of the reason why per capita GDP grows slowly is that population growth is outpacing the rate at which capital is accumulating through savings Thus, waiting for economic growth to dilute the incentives of couples to have many children may indefinitely postpone fertility reduction THE EFFECT OF CHILD MORTALITY There are good, additional reasons for the governments of developing countries to be more proactive with regard to population"}

There are several avenues, obvious in principle but perhaps not so easy to implement in practice One is to facilitate greater ownership of land by women Requiring by law the equal division of inheritance among all of one’s children, regardless of gender, is a measure that would help Providing a greater subsidy for the education of daughters rather than sons is another Empirically, the education of women is seen to be the single most important factor in the reduction of child mortality 14 Educated women provide better nutrition, are better able to identify serious health conditions in their children, and are better able to respond to them Easing access to credit is yet another measure for empowering women, because this enables them to increase their contribution to the household income This is what the well-known Grameen Bank has sought to do in Bangladesh, with considerable success Facilitating greater political participation of women would also help Empowering women would undoubtedly reduce fertility in developing countries but, as we have seen, it would not address the serious problem of biased sex ratios at birth When old-age security is provided mostly by male offspring, a reduction in fertility may result in a more blatant discrimination against female children, as is witnessed in China, Korea, and parts of India Given long-entrenched cultural norms, it is unlikely that women will readily be accepted as equals of men as providers of old-age security A feasible way to confront this problem is to render both male and female offspring irrelevant for old-age security purposes Implementation of a national social security system would go a long way toward eliminating the need for children (of either sex) to perform this function In one stroke, it would reduce fertility and, to a significant degree,"}

They are in general obtained from surveys of businessmen who are active in sample countries Thus these evaluations are likely to measure the gravity of corruption per transaction Let COR be such a measure We should expect this measure to decrease with the level of development The amount of corruption in a country can then be approximated by the level of activity open to corruption multiplied by the level of corruption The variable “per capita GDP” is a rough measure of the activity open to corruption if we assume that the share of transactions open to corruption is a constant share of per capita GDP Multiplying this variable by the level of corruption COR, we obtain a measure of the per capita amount of corruption the prediction is that this"}

The recent academic literature in economics has forcefully made the case that ethnic, racial, religious, and other social divisions are a major source of poor institutional performance and persistent global poverty Social scientists have proposed a range of reforms to address these divisions in less-developed countries, and of these, I believe that nation-building policies in language and education are the most promising The comparison between nearby districts in Kenya and Tanzania presented above suggests that concerted central government efforts to build a coherent national identity—centered around a common language, compelling political ideals and symbols, and the abolition of traditional tribal authorities—can successfully promote interethnic cooperation in sub–Saharan Africa, the world’s most ethnolinguistically diverse and poorest region, and the region with the slowest economic growth since the 1970s These policies may also be viewed more generally as investments in social capital (Putnam, 1993) Promoting nation-building policies will require a dramatic restructuring of cultural, educational, and language policies in many countries, and the centralized nature of this restructuring runs against current “Washington Consensus” thinking about economic development, which regards the promotion of strong central governments in less-developed countries with suspicion Nation-building in lessdeveloped countries is also likely to be opposed by powerful politicians in the global north, concerned that increasingly nationalistic—and assertive—lessdeveloped countries"}

{"id": 370, "text": "the programs vary substantially from country to country Northern European and Commonwealth countries have developed substantially more generous programs than Southern European countries and the United States Levels of generosity have steadily increased in Europe while there has been a cutback in the United States since the 1980s The United States targets aid to specific groups, such as the disabled, singleparent families, and the old, and often imposes tight limits on the duration of benefits,2 whereas many European countries have developed almost universal welfare programs covering most individuals with low incomes,3 and the duration of welfare payments and unemployment insurance is often much longer Redistributive programs toward the poor generate substantial controversy among policy makers and economists At the center of the controversy is an equity– efficiency trade-off On the one hand, governments value redistribution and want to transfer resources from the middle- and high-income earners toward low-income individuals On the other hand, such transfers are generally costly in terms of economic efficiency First, raising taxes to finance the income transfer programs may reduce labor supply or savings incentives among the middle- and high-income earners who have to pay the extra taxes Second, transfer programs may also reduce labor supply incentives of the low-income recipients As a result, these adverse labor supply effects may substantially raise the cost of improving the living standards of the poor The equity–efficiency trade-off is reflected in the political debate Liberals emphasize the redistributive benefits of transfer programs and their important role in raising the welfare of the most needy individuals and families Conservatives emphasize the efficiency costs, especially at the low-income end, blaming the welfare system for creating dependence and loss of economic self sufficiency (see, e g , Murray 1984, for such a point of view on the U S experience) The problem of redistribution is tackled in two steps in economics research The first step is a positive analysis in which economists develop models of individual behavior to understand how individuals or families respond to various transfer programs along various margins, such as labor supply, education, and human capital investment choices, or family and fertility decisions The central part of the positive analysis is the empirical estimation of the models of individual behavior in order to assess the quantitative magnitudes of behavioral responses In the United States and the United Kingdom, there is an enormous literature trying to estimate the size of the behavioral responses to most government transfer programs (see, e g , Bane and Ellwood 1994 Blundell and MaCurdy 1999 and Krueger and Meyer 2002 for recent surveys) The literature in other countries is smaller but growing quickly The second step is the normative analysis or optimal policy analysis Using models developed and estimated in the positive analysis, the normative analysis investigates the structure and size of the transfer program that should be implemented to maximize social welfare The social welfare criterion used by the government defines the redistributive tastes of the government Presumably, a liberal government would use a more redistributive criterion than a conservative government The normative analysis is crucial"}
{"id": 371, "text": "government would use a more redistributive criterion than a conservative government The normative analysis is crucial for policy-making because it shows how programs should be set or reformed in order to best attain the goals of the policy maker In particular, the normative analysis allows separate assessments of how changes in the redistributive tastes of the government and changes in the size of the behavioral responses to taxes and transfers affect the optimal redistributive program 4 The discussion in this essay is organized as follows The second section briefly describes the positive and empirical analysis (for which numerous good surveys are available) and focuses mostly on the normative analysis The third section starts with a discussion of the optimal structure of cash transfer programs, depending on the nature and size of labor supply responses We then extend the analysis of optimal transfer programs along various new dimensions First, we discuss whether programs should be universal or targeted to specific groups, such as single mothers or the disabled Second, we review whether in-kind transfers, such as food or shelter, or workfare programs, in which low-income individuals are required to perform some tasks for the government in order to receive public assistance, may be preferable to cash transfers Last, we briefly analyze the issue of time limits Is it preferable to have unlimited programs or to impose tight limits on the duration of benefits? The analysis of the third section is based on the standard assumption in economics that individuals do what is in their best interest However, there are strong reasons to suspect that, in many cases, individuals may not realize how beneficial a training program could be, or how detrimental for skills a long unemployment spell could be The fourth section discusses how the results of the third section might be affected in those situations where individuals may not be able to make the best choices for themselves Finally, the fifth section provides a conclusion and an educated (as well as personal) view on what should be done for redistribution toward low incomes It is important to note that while some of the problems described in this essay have been investigated in depth and relatively robust answers have been established, a number of situations reviewed here have received much less attention In these cases, the discussion presented here is more speculative and should be taken as an encouragement to research rather than as a collection of solidly established results OPTIMAL TRANSFER PROGRAMS Market economies generate substantial levels of income inequality Because earning and work abilities are very unequally distributed among individuals, without government intervention many individuals would end up with small or even no incomes The existence of poverty in a developed economy is generally considered a bad market outcome that ought to be corrected to some extent Surveys carried out in Western countries show that a very large majority favors some level of redistribution (see, for example, Alesina and La Ferrara 2001) Therefore, a government representing its constituents would like to transfer resources from those with high earnings abilities to the"}
{"id": 372, "text": "representing its constituents would like to transfer resources from those with high earnings abilities to the disadvantaged who have low earnings abilities or skills It is central to note that if earnings abilities were immutable and observable by the government, the government could base transfers directly on earning ability Such transfers would be independent of investment in human skill or work effort choices, and thus would not create negative incentives 5 However, earnings abilities cannot be observed directly, and can be inferred only indirectly, through market outcomes such as actual earnings Thus, the government has to base redistribution on market outcomes, earnings being the most obvious one Therefore, we first consider the benchmark case where transfers are based on income only, and we discuss below whether using other observable characteristics, such as family or disability status, can be useful to improve redistribution Cash Transfer Programs Most welfare programs are means-tested in the sense that benefits are reduced when earnings increase For example, TANF, as well as disability benefits and Supplemental Security Income for the old in the United States, or the French revenu minimum d’insertion are designed as means-tested programs Such a transfer schedule relating pretransfer income (horizontal axis) to after-transfer income is depicted in Figure 13 1a Absent any transfer program, pretransfer and after-transfer incomes would be identical, and thus the budget constraint would be the 45-degree line (the dashed line with slope 1 on the figure) The budget constraint with the transfer program is the solid line on Figure 13 1a a guaranteed income is given to those with no earnings, and benefits are phased out as earnings increase until the break-even point, at which benefits are lost altogether The phasing-out effectively reduces the slope of the budget constraint for each extra dollar of earnings, the after tax income increases by less than a dollar due to the reduction in benefits In actual programs, the phasing-out rate is in general high, often equal to one in which case benefits are lost one-for-one as earnings increase This type of program provides the largest benefits to those who have the lowest earnings, and hence are the most in need of income support However, these redistributive virtues come at a potentially high efficiency cost The introduction of such a program clearly induces recipients to work less, because the benefits provide extra income (income effect) and because recipients get to keep a much lower share of their earnings (substitution effect due to the phasing-out rate) A number of empirical studies surveyed in Krueger and Meyer (2002) have shown that these programs indeed have negative effects on labor supply, although the reductions in hours of work are typically fairly small for those who are in the labor force Figure 13 1a Pre-Transfer versus Post-Transfer Incomes in Traditional Welfare Programs Figure 13 1b Pre-Transfer versus Post-Transfer Incomes with Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) The normative analysis of the optimal shape of the transfer program (size of the guaranteed benefit and the phasing-out rate) was first investigated by Mirrlees (1971) He considered a simple model in which"}

{"id": 374, "text": "such programs on a more modest scale or are contemplating introducing such programs (see Gradus and Julsing 2001) The key feature missing in the Mirrlees (1971) model is the labor supply decision along the extensive margin, that is, the decision to enter the labor force Empirical studies (see, e g , Heckman 1993) have shown that the extensive margin response (choosing whether or not to enter the labor force) is much more elastic than the intensive response margin (choosing how many hours to work once one has decided to enter the labor force) The main reason why this is the case is the fixed costs of working search costs of finding a job, transportation costs, child care expenses, and so on Moreover, most jobs, including part-time jobs, require a minimum and regular number of hours per week As a result, very few people report working less than twenty hours per week Saez (2002) shows that a subsidy for low-skilled workers is optimal when labor supply responses are concentrated along the extensive margin The intuition is as follows introducing a subsidy for low-skilled workers is good for redistributive purposes and also induces some individuals to enter the labor force, and thus allows the government to save on welfare money In contrast, in a model with intensive margin responses, a subsidy for low-skilled workers would induce some higher-skill workers to work less in order to take advantage of the subsidy, and would thus increase the cost of the program That is why such subsidies are not optimal in the Mirrlees (1971) model Therefore, a government contemplating an increase of incentives for low-skilled workers must precisely weigh the positive effect on work participation and the negative intensive labor supply effect for higherskilled workers Saez (2002) presents simulations of this optimal transfer model using empirical estimates of the intensive and extensive elasticities of labor supply Since the extensive elasticity appears to be much larger than the intensive elasticity, the simulations show that the optimal program should have lower guaranteed benefits (perhaps around 20% of the average earnings in the economy) but that the phasing-out rate should close to zero on the first $6,000 of earnings, so as to make work pay and not deter labor force participation The benefits should then be phased out at substantial rates for earnings between $6,000 and $15,000 A high phasing-out rate in that earnings range creates only moderate reduction in labor supply because effort on the job (intensive margin) is not very sensitive to incentives The transfer programs we have described here are individually based and not family based However, in practice, transfer programs are often family based 7 The main reason for using the family is that welfare is better measured by family income than individual income For example, the nonworking spouse of a high-income husband has no earnings but is not in need However, the empirical literature has shown that labor supply of secondary earners is much more sensitive to incentives than labor supply of primary earners (see, e g , Killingsworth and Heckman 1986) Therefore, basing transfers"}

{"id": 379, "text": "situations) There is a large literature in labor economics evaluating the costs and benefits of training programs for low-skilled and low-income earners (see, e g , Heckman et al 1999 for a recent comprehensive survey) Such programs are designed to improve future earnings of the trainees, and thus can be justified only if trainees are myopic (and do not realize the full benefits of being trained) or are credit constrained (and hence not able to borrow to pay for their training) The empirical literature has shown that in general training has a positive impact on future earnings, but is of modest size in most cases Thus the gains in earnings rarely cover the training costs However, the benefits of those programs are very heterogeneous across groups and particular programs For example, Ifcher (2004) shows that the job placement assistance program set in place by New York City in 1999 for its welfare recipients had a very strong effect on the probability of finding a job and leaving welfare permanently, and thus was cost-effective Therefore, this suggests that subtle variations in the way those training programs work or small differences in the environment in which they take place can have a dramatic impact on their success Indeed, the empirical behavioral literature has shown that in a number of contexts, differences in the environment which should be irrelevant for a standard rational economic agent can have very large impacts on actual economic decisions 13 Therefore, it is plausible to think that such framing effects might also be very important in the context of transfer programs An important challenge for future research is to understand precisely under which circumstances such programs can be successful in helping low-income earners CONCLUSION This essay has presented a critical overview of the findings of economic research on the problem of redistribution toward low incomes There are a number of important conclusions that emerge First, the behavioral labor supply responses to transfers, even though significant, are not so large that the costs of redistribution necessarily outweigh the benefits Given the size of empirical behavioral responses, substantial transfers could be carried out that would greatly improve the welfare of the poorest families and individuals in American society at a reasonable cost for middle- and higher-income earners Therefore, the difference in the size of redistribution between the United States and Northern Europe might be due to differences in the redistributive tastes and political processes of those societies Second, since empirical studies have found that the labor supply response is concentrated along the participation margin, it would be desirable to structure welfare programs so as to encourage work participation of beneficiar-ies 14 A valuable way to do this is to lower the welfare payments for those who do not have any earnings but allow welfare recipients to keep their full earnings in addition of welfare payments up to a limit The level of welfare payments should of course depend on the number of dependents (in particular children) but should also cover single individuals with no dependents in order not to leave out of"}

One commonly heard view is that the poor are roughly equally poor in the poorest countries, and there are so many of them and resources are so limited, that these policies are a nonstarter However, while the extent of poverty and the resource limitations are both clear enough, it is now well established from household survey data that even in the poorest countries, the differences in levels of living among the poor can be sizable 1 A high incidence of poverty does not diminish the equity case for targeting limited resources to the poorest first Another long-standing critique of this class of policies has potentially more weight This says that leakage of benefits to nontarget groups and adverse incentive effects on the labor supply and savings of transfer recipients create a serious tradeoff against efficiency and growth, which is seen to be crucial to rapid poverty reduction For example, an article on redistribution in Britain in"}

REVISITING THE EQUITY-EFFICIENCY TRADE-OFF The presumption that there is an aggregate trade-off between the twin goals of economic growth and lower inequality can be questioned for a number of reasons Unless a person can initially assure that her basal metabolic rate (BMR)—the food energy intake needed to support bodily functions at rest—is reached, there can be no productive activity of any sort This “threshold effect” can mean that an economy generates massive involuntary unemployment under one distribution of assets, while a more equitable distribution yields full employment and high output (Dasgupta and Ray 1986) Credit market failures also entail that some people are unable to exploit growthpromoting opportunities for investment in (physical and human) capital Aggregate output is the sum of"}

Compilations of aggregate data on growth and distribution suggest that countries with higher initial inequality tend to experience lower rates of growth, controlling for other factors including initial income, openness to trade, and the rate of inflation 6 Indeed, very high inequality can stifle progress against poverty it has been estimated that this is the case for about one fifth of the date-country combinations in a data set for developing countries (Ravallion 1997b) There are a number of concerns about the data and methods used in testing for an aggregate equity-efficiency trade-off, and the biases can go either way There are measurement errors in both the levels and the changes in measured income inequality, including comparability problems between countries and over time arising from errors in survey data (both sampling and nonsampling errors) and heterogeneity in survey design and processing 7 There are also concerns about the presence of unobserved factors influencing the growth process—factors that might be correlated with initial inequality, thus making it hard to say whether higher inequality is really the cause of lower growth The latter concern can be dealt with by allowing"}

{"id": 397, "text": "program—it was estimated that about one half of gross wage earnings was taken up by forgone incomes 26 In the Trabajar program, the income lost to participating workers was probably compensated by indirect gains to the poor as residents of the neighborhoods in which the work was done, which typically involved the creation and maintenance of valued local infrastructure Calculation of the cost-effectiveness of this program suggests that it still only costs about $1 00 to $1 50 to transfer $1 00 to the poor, even taking account of the deadweight loss due to costs of participation 27 However, workfare programs have traditionally underemphasized the potential value to the poor of the assets created, which appear often to benefit mainly the nonpoor or to be of little value to anyone (see, for example, Gaiha 1996, writing about Maharashtra’s EGS) The Trabajar program illustrates the potential for a new wave of workfare programs that emphasize asset creation in poor communities The program’s design gave explicit incentives (through the ex ante project selection process) for targeting the work to poor areas, again compensating for the market failures that help create poor areas in the first place There is typically much useful work to do in poor neighborhoods—work that probably would not get financed otherwise In macroeconomic or agroclimatic crises, it is to be expected that the emphasis will shift to current income gains, away from asset creation—implying, for example, more labor-intensive subprojects on workfare programs (for further discussion, see Ravallion 1999b) However, the appropriate trade-off between the objective of raising current incomes of the poor versus reducing future poverty will never be a straightforward choice Sustainability and Political Economy While theory points to efficiency gains from permanent redistribution, the implications of short-term redistributions are less clear The insurance gains from targeted transfers also depend on the sustainability of programs across different states of nature, including coverage across groups facing different risks In these respects the record is mixed Some programs, such as the EGS, have been sustained over long periods, and appear to have provided effective insurance This can help assure sustainability, since (given that there is idiosyncratic risk) the potential set of beneficiaries is much larger than the actual set at any one date It clearly also helps if the nonpoor see benefits from effective social protection, such as in attenuating migration to cities in times of stress in rural areas However, other designs for targeted transfer schemes have been more short-lived Sustainability depends on having broad political support, which can be at odds with fine targeting Thus there may well be a trade-off between sustainability and the extent of redistribution by this means Political economy clearly looms large in this area of policy-making The fact that inequality is inefficiently high need not mean that there will be an effective political response to lower it Benabou (2000) has demonstrated theoretically that an economy with persistently high inequality, and little effort to reduce it, can coexist with one that is otherwise identical in fundamentals but in which active redistribution keeps inequality low External agents,"}

What kinds of policies might affect the nature of dynamics in and out of poverty? The discussions of measurement and policy seem to operate in a theoretical vacuum, with no emphasis on understanding mechanisms of causation They tend to take as given the current distribution of assets and capabilities and figure out how to measure the extent of deprivation (in terms of consumption or income outcomes) and how to relieve it in the short run, ignoring possible implications for the future evolution of poverty Whatever little analytical content there is, concerns discussions of work disincentive effects and targeting in the design of antipoverty policies The underlying analytical framework is a Mirrlees (1971) optimal income tax model Each agent in the economy is characterized by a given income earning capability, and selects a work effort The government can monitor only achieved incomes, which depend on the conjunction of ability and effort Low-ability individuals would hardly be able to earn any income despite the application of effort, and thus fall into poverty (defined by some income threshold) An antipoverty policy would provide income support for these households, financed by taxes on higher-ability households By their very nature, the benefits provided must be phased out as household incomes rise and cross the threshold, thereby creating a work disincentive The more comprehensive the coverage at the bottom end, the higher the taxes needed and the steeper the benefit phaseout must be, weakening incentives of the poor to raise their incomes and escape poverty on their own This is the fundamental trade-off, the resolution of which depends on labor supply elasticity, the distribution of abilities, and societal inequality aversion Mirrlees’s own calculations, based on British data, suggested that a substantial part of the population may be induced not to work at all in the optimal policy, even with relatively low inequality aversion Whatever support is provided to the"}

{"id": 418, "text": "this essay I make no attempt to survey the economic literature on child labor Basu (1999) already provides an excellent review In the second section, I briefly describe some of the main features of child labor in developing countries Poverty and child labor are mutually reinforcing because their parents are poor, children must work and therefore remain out of school As a consequence, these children grow up to be poor as adults, and the cycle continues In the third section, I discuss the first of two features of child labor that give it a central place in a vicious cycle of poverty This is the fact that the primary costs of child labor are realized so far in the future When financial markets are poorly developed, the separation in time between the immediate benefits and long-delayed costs of sending children to work can result in too much child labor The second feature is that the costs and benefits of child labor are not only separated in time they are borne by different people the child suffers the main consequences, while other household members benefit This problem of agency is discussed in the fourth section Finally, the fifth section concludes with a discussion of child labor policies PATTERNS OF CHILD LABOR The International Labour Office (2002) estimates that about 210 million children between the ages of five and fourteen were working in 2000, about half of them working full-time That implies that approximately one in ten of the world’s children were working full-time At the same time, UNESCO estimates that about one of every five primary school-aged children were not enrolled in school The absolute numbers of children working are largest in Asia, but the incidence of child labor seems to be highest in Africa the ILO estimates that about one third of children are economically active in Africa, about one sixth working full-time Child labor is overwhelmingly a rural and agricultural phenomenon For example, in Pakistan, 70% of working children are employed in agriculture (Pakistan FBS1996) Boys are more likely to work than girls, and older children are much more likely to be employed than their younger siblings (Grootaert and Patrinos 1999) Our concern focuses on child labor that involves the sacrifice of a child’s future welfare in exchange for a current benefit to the household This is clearly the notion that motivates most child labor policy, and lies behind ILO Convention number 138 1 The benefits to the household of sending a child to work are the wages of that child (or, equivalently, the increased production on the family farm) and the reduced education expenditures from not sending her to school The primary costs of child labor are the lower future earnings of the child when she enters the adult labor market with lower educational attainment In addition, there is very strong evidence of important nonmarket returns to education in child rearing the children of welleducated parents, particularly mothers, are healthier The sacrifice of these returns should also be counted as a cost of child labor Finally, there are benefits to"}

This is inherently a difficult question to answer, because child labor and school enrollment influence one another Is a child not in school because she is working? Or is she working because there are no good opportunities for her to be schooled? Or is she sacrificing leisure to both work and attend school? However, the existing evidence is strong For example, Psacharopoulos (1997) shows much lower educational attainment by children who work in Venezuela and Boliva Using a very different methodology, Boozer and Suri (2001) find similar results for child labor and school attendance in Ghana Households that are very poor are much more likely to send their children to work, and child labor contributes to poverty in the next generation by reducing schooling attainment This circular pattern of positive feedback between poverty and child labor may lead to a vicious cycle of poverty, in which the descendants of the poor remain poor because they were poorly educated This cycle can be the foundation of a classical “poverty trap ” However, if the cycle can be broken, the same positive circular causation can contribute to a takeoff into sustained growth If schooling attainments can be improved, then the next generation’s income is higher and their children can in turn become yet better educated It is essential, therefore, to understand the specific mechanisms that can trap people in the awful equilibrium of persistent poverty, excessive child labor, and low education over generations The crucial mechanisms are, first, an inability to seize advantageous longrun investments in children’s human capital because of credit market constraints and, second, problems of agency within households These two mechanisms operate simultaneously and can interact in important ways IMPERFECT FINANCIAL MARKETS, CHILD LABOR, AND INVESTMENT IN HUMAN CAPITAL I begin by abstracting from any problems associated with agency, and assume that parents fully internalize the costs of sending their children to work From the point of view of society, what is the appropriate level of child labor? Suppose, to start, that the costs of working and the benefits of schooling are entirely private that is, they are limited to the increased productivity, and therefore income, of better-educated adults For now, therefore, we are ignoring the benefits of well-educated individuals for the rest of society The benefit of child labor is the current wage earned by the child (and the reduced cost of schooling) These benefits are realized immediately, so no discounting is required The costs of additional child labor are the lower wages that the child receives when she grows up less well-educated because she worked as a child These costs are realized in the far future, so for cost–benefit analysis we calculate the present"}
{"id": 421, "text": "These costs are realized in the far future, so for cost–benefit analysis we calculate the present discounted value of these costs For a given absolute cost, a higher interest rate implies a lower present discounted value of the cost From a social point of view, it is efficient to increase child labor and reduce schooling up to the point at which the present discounted value of future costs of additional child labor are just balanced by the current benefit to the household of that additional child labor It need not be the case that the socially efficient level of child labor is zero this will depend upon the productivity of child labor, the degree to which schooling improves future productivity, and the interest rate at which future earnings are discounted For example, if a child already has sufficient schooling so that further years of education have a relatively small impact on her future income, and if she could generate a lot of income by working, and if interest rates are relatively high, then the immediate benefit of having the child work might be sufficiently large to offset the present discounted value of her future lower earnings as a less well-educated adult On the other hand, if further schooling for the child would greatly increase her future income, and if the current income she could earn by working is relatively low, and if interest rates are low, then the immediate benefit of the child working would not be sufficient to outweigh the present discounted value of her future higher income from attending school, and from a social point of view she should stay in school If financial markets operate smoothly and there are no issues of agency, this is precisely the calculus that will guide the decisions of parents regarding work and school for their children In this case, even if parents are poor, perfect credit markets permit them to borrow to finance the education of their children, confident in their ability to repay the loan out of the increased earnings of their well-educated adult children These private decisions will be socially optimal Obviously, if the rest of society benefits from children’s improved education, then these benefits will not be fully taken into account by parents as they invest in their children’s schooling In this case, from a social point of view the level of child labor will be too high, and the level of schooling too low even if financial markets operate smoothly The existence of these social benefits from schooling is an important element in the traditional argument for subsidization of education and public schooling However, even if these social benefits are unimportant, in the real world financial markets are not sufficiently well developed to support the optimal calculus described in the first three paragraphs of this section A parent who is unable to smoothly transfer income from the far future into the present by borrowing will choose too high a level of child labor Consider a very simple example, in which the parent can borrow, but only at an interest"}

{"id": 423, "text": "3 In this case, some of the more persuasive evidence comes from a series of studies that relate both school attendance and child labor to transitory income shocks afflicting households that can be attributed to random events outside the control of the household The importance of the last two phrases is that these studies aim to identify households that are temporarily poor (or rich) for no particular reason—it was just an act of God If this can be done, we can argue that the only difference between households that have a temporary good shock and those that have a temporary bad shock is that (on average) those with a good shock are relatively well off To understand the importance of such evidence, consider a hypothetical household engaged in farming in a developing country Like all farmers, this family is subject to random, transitory shocks that affect its income (think of shocks such as a localized flood) An important consequence of well-developed financial markets is that this family’s decisions regarding the education and labor force participation of its children would be entirely unaffected by the realization of such transitory shocks The present discounted value of the future costs of child labor are unaffected by any temporary production shock The immediate benefits are unaffected as well, as long as the shock is sufficiently localized that the wage for child labor does not change 4 Therefore, if this family has access to smoothly operating credit markets, it will simply borrow (or draw down its savings) to maintain its base level of consumption despite the adverse shock, and the schooling and labor status of its children would remain unchanged This conclusion no longer holds when the family cannot borrow and does not hold savings over the long term Now, faced with an adverse transitory shock, a poor household is forced into a stark choice maintain the school enrollment of the children and face a decline in an already inadequate level of consumption, or try to protect the family’s current living standard by relying on increased child labor Moreover, if we are convinced that these adverse shocks are distributed randomly through the population, and that the only effect of these shocks is to temporarily lower income, then we can be confident that the causal connection truly does run from income to schooling and child labor Beegle et al (2002) provides a good example of this approach They find that rural Tanzanian children work more when their family farms have experienced adverse events such as fires or loss due to insects or rodents The survey they use followed households over three years, so they can also show that this effect is temporary children work more when their household is poorer as a consequence of suffering from these events, then they work less when the household recovers Finally, they show that the sensitivity of child labor to these shocks is greatest for poorer households with fewer assets that can serve as collateral, thus providing further support for the hypothesis that imperfect financial markets play a central role in determining"}

The two parents might hold divergent views about these costs and benefits In fact, there is mounting evidence that this is so, and that these divergent opinions can have important effects on child welfare Until fairly recently, economists had ignored issues of agency within households, relying on what has come to be called the “unitary household model ” This model assumes that the choices made in households can be treated as if they were made by a single individual There was never much of a theoretical justification for this assumption it was made for convenience, driven by the"}

However, if child labor is indeed a means of coping with desperate poverty, families are sending children to work only when the current value of the income they earn is greater than the (discounted value) of the future benefits of education Lowering the wage of child labor to induce the family to send the child to school makes the family worse off Trade sanctions are a particularly inappropriate tool for dealing with the challenge of child labor As noted above, there is a legitimate case for bans on particular forms of child labor If there is to be any developed-country intervention in these cases, it would be more appropriate in the form of diplomatic pressure and more general rewards and punishments to encourage government action to avoid the adverse effects of trade sanctions on the very children they are meant to help We have seen that dysfunctional financial markets are an important cause of child labor Child labor would be dramatically reduced if parents could finance their children’s exit from the labor force and entry into schooling from the increased future earnings of the child Unfortunately, extremely well-functioning credit markets are required to make this kind of transaction feasible The"}

The most effective way to draw children out of damaging work is to encourage school attendance One way of doing so would be to improve school quality, and therefore increase the gain from attending school Handa (2002), for example, argues that school enrollment in Mozambique is quite sensitive to the number of trained teachers This is an important tool that is available to reduce child labor However, it has the significant disadvantage of influencing outcomes in the distant future, when the higher quality of schooling leads to higher wages as an adult The influence of these changes on future outcomes of current decisions regarding work and schooling is scaled down by credit constraints and agency problems The most promising tool yet developed for reducing child labor is a targeted subsidy to families sending their children to school In such a program, a grant is provided to the family of any child who is enrolled in school The particular value of this intervention is that it addresses the root causes of child labor It overcomes the problems associated with imperfect or nonexistent financial markets by balancing the current cost of moving a child out of the labor force and into school with a current grant It addresses the main agency problem by providing current resources, thus reducing the importance of intergenerational transfers For a priori reasons, then, we can expect subsidies for school enrollment to be a useful tool in the effort to reduce child labor A number of such programs have been implemented in recent years The flagship program of this type is the innovative Progresa poverty program in Mexico (the name of the program has recently been changed to Oportunidades) Progresa provides mothers of enrolled students in rural Mexico with grants that have a value slightly less than the wage that would be earned by the child if she were working full-time With remarkable foresight, the Progresa program was introduced (in 1998) in a randomized sequence This randomization, combined with systematic data collection, makes it possible to measure with great confidence the impact of the program on both school enrollment and child labor force participation Schultz (2004) estimates that the program has resulted in an increase in schooling of about two thirds of a year (from a baseline attainment of 6 8 years), and that child labor correspondingly falls The most dramatic effects are for secondary school girls, whose broad labor force participation is estimated to drop by almost fifty percentage points upon enrollment in school 7 Inspired by the Progresa example, Nicaragua instituted the Red de Pro-tección Social (RPS) in 2000 This program also provides grants for"}

{"id": 432, "text": "to 352 million if we consider children up to the age of seventeen years The ILO distinguishes “child labor” from “economically active children” by asserting that a child above the age of twelve who does light, part-time work that is not hazardous may be economically active but is not to be counted as a child laborer By making this adjustment, and treating a child as someone below the age of fifteen, we find that in the year 2000 there were 186 million child laborers the world over Evidently, the problem is large And there are researchers who claim that it is larger than the ILO statistics suggest For one thing, the ILO finds that boys are more likely than girls to be laborers This is quite consistent with official data from around the world and from nineteenth-century Britain, but in the few cases where data were collected with special effort to include domestic work, as was done in India (see Cigno and Rosati 2000), it was found out that girls do more work than boys Hence, it is arguable that the amount of girls’ work estimated by the ILO falls short of the true figure Then there is the problem of “intermittent employment ” Analysts have long suspected, and now we have formal statistics from Brazil showing, that children are much more prone to being in and out of work than adults (Levison et al 2002) Hence, if we try to find out how many children are working simply by tracking their work status during the previous week, as the ILO did, we get an underestimate of the number of children who do some work Admittedly, this does not mean an underestimate of the amount of work done by children No matter which indicator one uses to describe the magnitude of labor performed by children, it must, by now, be amply clear that the phenomenon of child labor presents us with a staggeringly large policy problem 1 THE POLICY PROBLEM In crafting policy in the domain of child labor, one has, first of all, to be careful to guard against what is best described as the “fallacy of single-mindedness ” While it is undoubtedly bad for a child to have to work, it is easy for us to forget that worse things can happen to a child than having to work Hunger, serious illness, malnutrition, abandonment by family, and prostitution are all states of being or activities from which a child would readily switch to regular labor Thus, when we try to eliminate child labor, we must be careful not to achieve this by driving children to these worse alternatives Policy makers and even academics at times make the mistake of being so single-minded in their aim to control child labor that they do not mind if this is achieved at the expense of the welfare of the very children whom the intervention is intended to help Basu and Van (1998) have warned against this risk and have shown that while there may indeed be occasions when a legal ban on child"}

No But nevertheless there are two reasons to be interested in this question First, we do not have evidence of the opposite (that is, the proposition that fines for employing child labor curb child labor) either What we have is simply a presumption that this must be so And I want to show that a simple analysis, based on straightforward assumptions for which we do have empirical evidence, shows that the presumption is faulty Thus this analysis demonstrates the need for future empirical analysis The second reason is that there is considerable informal evidence that child labor is a hard problem to solve Repeated interventions, since 1802 in Britain, have met with resistance and a failure to buck the problem The evidence, which I briefly discuss below, suggests that policies for controlling child labor may not be as obvious as they seem The possibility of “pathological” reaction to seemingly obvious interventions cannot, offhand, be ruled out Serious attempts to combat child labor began with Robert Peel’s Factories Act of 1802 in Britain Subsequently, progressively tougher laws were ushered in, but the incidence of child labor remained high, seemingly impervious to the interventions According to the census of England and Wales, in 1861 the labor participation rate for boys aged ten to fourteen years was 36 9%, and for girls of the same age group it was 20 5% This is comparable with some of the poorest developing countries today In the United States the attempt to legally control child labor began in 1837 in Massachusetts Yet the incidence of child labor began declining noticeably only after 1880 For the United States, 1880 to 1910 was the period of rapid decline of child labor This was also the period during which legislation against child labor was enacted with greater intensity It is therefore easy to presume that child labor declined because of the law But a detailed study by Moehling (1999), which made use of the fact that different states in the United States had laws of differing stringency against child labor,3 showed that the law had very little effect on the incidence of child labor While there is need for formal empirical analysis of the effect of law on child labor, the broad evidence suggests that the effect may not be what people take it to be at face value Indeed, it can be shown that when it comes to the use of a fine for employing children, the effect can be the opposite of what we may expect The reason why imposing a fine on firms for employing children can cause child labor to increase is intimately"}
{"id": 435, "text": "imposing a fine on firms for employing children can cause child labor to increase is intimately connected to the fact that poverty is a major cause of child labor To see the intuition behind this, take the extreme case where a household chooses to send its children to work in order to escape extreme poverty or starvation 4 When child labor is the product of trying to reach a target (such as a subsistence consumption), any policy that makes child labor a less effective instrument in reaching such a target will result in a more intensive use of this instrument Now if there is a new law whereby firms are fined whenever they are caught using child labor, clearly this will cause the wage rate for child labor to drop This is because children are now a less attractive input from the point of view of firms But this in turn will mean children will have to work even harder to be able to earn the target minimum income that they are after The full analysis is a bit more complicated Note that if the fines are made so big that the firms no longer wish to employ any children, of course child labor will fall (whether this is desirable from a welfare-consequentialist point of view is another matter) The general result that is established here is that as the fine for using child labor is increased, child labor will first rise and then fall The larger policy implications of this result will be discussed after I have established it formally The result that I am about to prove can be derived under fairly general conditions but, since I wish to prove it without complex algebra, I shall use some strong simplifying assumptions for reasons of ex-positional convenience The assumptions that are (more than mere simplifying ones and) central to my analysis are that (1) children are made to work only so as to achieve a certain target minimum consumption for the household and (2) child and adult laborers are substitutes, subject to, possibly, an adult equivalency correction Even these assumptions are overstated for simplicity We know, for instance, that when a relatively poor household comes to own more land (and this may be coincident with becoming a little richer), it tends to make its children work more (Bhalotra and Heady 2003) This indicates that while poverty is an important cause of child labor, it is not the sole cause For instance, the ease with which a child can be employed, which no doubt increases as the household’s landownership increases, can influence the incidence of child labor (Basu and Tzannatos 2003) While it is possible to take these complications on board and still derive the result I am about to derive, I shall work with the more extreme assumptions embodied in (1) and (2) in order to get the main argument across simply Fortunately, there is now plenty of hard evidence supporting assumption (1) (see, for instance, Grootaert and Patrinos 1999 and Edmonds 2001), and though (2) has not been studied much,"}

{"id": 437, "text": "Of course, this cannot go on endlessly, since after some time the household will run out of children From then on, as w drops, there will be no further increase in supply of child labor, since all children are already working But the general point is now amply clear—there will be a segment of the supply curve that is backward-bending Many of the peculiarities of the child labor market with which the literature has been concerned, such as the possibility of multiple equilibria (Basu and Van 1998 Basu 2002 Swinnerton and Rogers 1999 Bardhan and Udry 1999 Lopez-Calva 2003), can easily be constructed by using this kind of supply characterization But that is not the direction I wish to pursue here To stay away from that, let me consider the case where (the demand curve is sufficiently elastic so that) there is only one equilibrium, and at this equilibrium there is some child labor My concern here is with policy interventions and to show how there can be an adverse reaction to certain seemingly reasonable interventions Consider the case where the government, starting from the equilibrium where there is some child labor, decides to raise the fine for employing children (We could also think of a switch from no fines [that is, D = 0] to some positive fine ) This will mean that employing children will be more expensive for the firms, because with each child employed there is the risk of being caught and having to pay the larger fine to the government Hence, as the penalty for employing children rises, the market will make sure that the child wage will drop Otherwise, no firm will demand children But once the child wage drops, each household will be forced to send more children to work to meet the subsistence consumption target And herein lies the essence of the pathology an increased fine for employing children could raise the level of child labor Indeed, this result obtains so naturally that it is not clear that it should be thought of as pathology at all If, however, the government continues to raise the penalty for employing children (D) and/or the probability (p) of catching firms that employ children, the above result will cease to hold To see this, suppose a government keeps raising D This will cause the child wage to fall In the extreme, the child wage will drop to zero That is, child employment is so risky for the firm that a firm will agree to employ a child only if it does not have to pay a wage But when this happens, raising the child labor supply will not fetch the household any extra income Thus the child labor supply will drop to zero In other words, there will be no child labor in the economy To sum up, a small punishment for child labor may have quite the opposite effect of a large punishment, because the relation between the size of the penalty for employing children and the amount of child labor may be an inverted U A"}
{"id": 438, "text": "penalty for employing children and the amount of child labor may be an inverted U A small penalty raises child labor but a large one puts an end to it It will indeed be interesting to check this result out empirically It is worth emphasizing that here I have not evaluated policy from the point of view of child welfare but have simply studied its effect on the incidence of child labor And, as I have cautioned above and elsewhere in my writings, a decline in child labor need not always coincide with a rise in child welfare Before moving on, I must attend to one seeming difficulty with the above analysis Since, as we have just shown, in some cases the child labor problem is made worse by the imposition of a fine for employing children, it seems natural to wonder if the problem of child labor can be mitigated by subsidizing firms for employing children The answer is no A subsidy does not work like the reverse of a tax or a penalty Thus it would clearly be wrong policy to reward firms for employing children To see this, we must understand something that was handled above by not talking about it Suppose that a firm decides to use C units of child labor Clearly it can do this by employing different numbers of children It can, for instance, employ 2C children with each child doing half-time work or C children with each child working full-time, and so on In most models of economics, it does not matter how the total is broken up, and it is implicitly assumed that firms make each worker do full-time work, so that for C units of labor it uses C laborers In the above model, with a penalty for every child that is found working in the firm, a firm will have a clear preference for employing as few children as possible, since each child brings with him or her a possible penalty The trouble with a subsidy for employing children is that this implicit assumption (which is valid when there is a fine associated with child labor) breaks down In the presence of a subsidy for each child employed, it will be in the interest of the firms to get the same volume of labor from many children, then take these children to the local government office as proof of child labor and collect the subsidy In other words, announcing a subsidy would cause a fiscal crisis, with firms making notional use of child labor and collecting money CONCLUDING REMARKS There has been a lot of discussion in the literature on what should be the right agency for controlling child labor Should it be the national government or should it be some global body, such as the WTO or the ILO?

{"id": 439, "text": "involved in answering these questions, many of them mired in intricate matters of political economy and international law (see, for instance, Fung et al 2001) Economists such as Bhagwati (1995) have rightly worried about empowering agencies such as the WTO, to which poor countries have inadequate access and which can quickly be converted to an instrument of northern protectionism Likewise, I would hesitate to turn this matter over to consumers in industrialized nations to exercise control through product boycotts, since this can also be an instrument of protection and because we know—and Arthur Miller has immortalized this in drama—how witch hunts come easily, with a little egging on by interested lobbies (Basu 2001) But even apart from these larger questions of political economy, we need to contend with narrow questions concerning the kinds of instruments (whoever implements them) that ought to be used Should we try to control child labor by offering free meals to children who go to school? Or should we control child labor by, instead, creating better schools?6 Should we try to curb child labor by punishing those who employ children or parents who allow their children to work? And if we decide to do either, what should the punishment be? Policy makers, governments, and international organizations often pay no attention to these details in exhorting us to act What this essay has tried to show is that such exhortations, without closer analysis of exactly how we should act, may not be of much value and can even be counterproductive ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Some of the ideas expressed here were part of a lecture given at the third MULTI conference in Bergen, Norway, on May 24, 2002 The essay has benefited from the comments of Abhijit Banerjee, Hyejin Ku, Per Boltof Maurseth, and Dilip Mookherjee I am also grateful to the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Kolkata, where a part of this work was done NOTES 1 In Basu (1999) I have discussed how the magnitude of child labor in today’s world compares with the situation in nineteenth-century Britain For detailed analyses of the historical evidence, see Moehling (1999) and Humphries (2003) 2 It must be clarified that to say that poverty causes child labor is not to deny that child labor can have other causes, such as greater opportunity for child work, lack of schooling opportunity, or parental illiteracy (see, for instance, Emerson and Souza 2002 Bhalotra and Heady 2003), just as a fire being caused by a carelessly discarded cigarette stub does not preclude the spilled kerosene on the floor from being a cause 3 This would change in 1938, when the Fair Labor Standards Act brought the entire nation under a uniform code of labor standards 4 The analysis in this essay is not predicated on households taking the decision concerning child labor The results go through even if child labor is an autonomous decision of the child, which is empirically not as remote as some may have assumed (see Iversen 2002) 5 Formally, e (w – pD) = s – w Recall that w – pD"}

{"id": 442, "text": "true for a host of reasons, which complicates attempts to quantify the causal effects of schooling on earnings In developing countries, wealthier families can afford to educate their children, and can aid them in finding superior jobs Untangling which part of earnings is due to education, and which part to (say) the quality of family connections, is often far from straightforward Years of completed schooling may also reflect a person’s abilities, and those who are more able would be expected to earn higher incomes, regardless of schooling Further complications arise because schooling is of uneven quality, so that, among children in South Africa, for example, having completed six years of schooling in rural KwaZulu-Natal may be very different from completing the same number of years in Durban More broadly, this last point highlights the problems caused by the rather noisy measures of schooling we generally have available for analysis not only does schooling vary in quality, but people misremember the number of years they have obtained, and (perhaps more often) their schooling is misremembered by the “knowledgeable household member” chosen to act as the family’s informant in many household surveys Since the 1970s, much has been learned about the relationship between education and earnings, largely due to marked improvements in the quantity and quality of data collected, and to the attention paid to the measurement issues raised above by both economic theorists and applied economists 1 Several strategies have been suggested to quantify the impact of education on earnings For example, some researchers have looked at differences in earnings between siblings and have correlated these with differences in their educations To the extent that siblings have the same access to family resources and contacts, the differences in earnings between them may be attributable to the differences in their educational attainment While such a strategy may succeed in neutralizing the role of families, it doesn’t explain why siblings differ in their years of schooling If these differences are due to differences in ability, then this sort of strategy could end up magnifying the bias caused by unobserved ability A second tack in analyzing returns to schooling has been to focus on those differences in years of completed schooling that can be attributed to institutional differences, between places or over time Differences in proximity to a school, enforced minimum school leaving ages, or restrictions on child labor may lead some children to attend school longer Differences in completed schooling that can be attributed to such institutional arrangements may meet the statistical requirements necessary for them to be useful in estimating returns to education For example, in recent work Duflo (2001) analyzes the impact of a massive school-building program in Indonesia where, between 1973 and 1978, 61,000 primary schools were built, targeted in those areas in which children were least likely to have been enrolled prior to the building program Children young enough to benefit from the new schools, who were living in areas targeted for school building, completed more years of schooling on average Observing these children as working adults, Duflo estimates an economic"}

Is it more important for a school with a fixed budget to reduce class sizes or to increase teachers’ salaries? Do student outcomes respond more to the availability of textbooks or to enhanced teacher incentives? Understanding the impact of school inputs is indeed an important goal, one that has spawned a very large literature devoted to measuring the impact of school inputs Unfortunately, most papers in this literature attribute a causal effect to the association between school inputs and student performance, which is not appropriate if resource allocation responds to students’ needs, as will almost always be the case Schools and parents can and do respond to the academic readiness of their children by moving the levers they have available—setting class sizes and allocating teachers’ aides and classroom resources, for example That schools respond to children’s academic readiness makes it difficult to evaluate the relative merits of different inputs, and adds much confusion to the debate over resource effectiveness School Inputs as Choice Variables This point is addressed thoughtfully in a paper by Lazear (1999), who builds on the idea that, at any point during the schoolday, there is some chance that any given student will be “disruptive,” initiating behavior that temporarily stops other students in the class from learning “Disruptive”"}

If externalities are limited to within ethnic groups, then the total demand for public goods, such as roads and education, that benefit all groups will be less For example, if ethnic groups are separated geographically, there will be little demand for interregional travel Similarly, if the different ethnic groups speak different languages and have different cultures, they will be less willing to support investment in public education INSTITUTION DESIGN ISSUES We now discuss aspects of institution design that are critical in understanding publicgoods provision Thus, we abstract from funding issues and ask how public goods can be provided effectively at a given funding level We focus on four issues how incentives work in organizations charged with providing public goods the scope for private provision via NGOs and contracting out to for-profit firms the case for decentralized provision and the role of competition Incentive Design for Public-Goods Provision Whether provided by state or private organizations, individuals need to be motivated to provide goods that achieve collective benefits The traditional model of state provision assumes away incentive problems, believing that"}

This affects the extent to which agents working together to produce public goods and the beneficiaries have congruent objectives What do these considerations imply about how agents providing public goods should be rewarded? In terms of standard incentive theory, it is well known (see, for example, Dixit 2002) that in these environments, low-powered incentives are likely to be optimal If performance measures are noisy, then making rewards very sensitive to performance does not give effective incentives, and imposes unnecessary risk on the employee If the employee has to do several tasks, and some of these have good performance measures and others do not, then making her pay sensitive to the good performance measures will cause her to substitute effort away from the other tasks, and could result in a loss of efficiency The fact that providers may be motivated is also very important This may reinforce the tendency toward low-powered incentives If the employee receives a nonmonetary reward for doing her job well, then clearly she can be paid a lower wage and her pay does not have to be made very sensitive to her performance Of course, the incentive structures offered for providing public goods may affect who chooses to work within the public-goods-producing sector Lower wages may act as a screening device, attracting only those workers who have a desire to achieve the social good However, there are important caveats to this strategy First, there may be a tradeoff if individuals differ in their abilities With lower wages and low-powered incentives, the public sector may end up being a haven for well-meaning but incompetent individuals There may also be an adverse selection problem if there are some dishonest individuals who will use the public sector to pursue private ends Besley and McLaren (1993)"}

Should the government retain the ownership of the public good (say, a school) and ask an NGO to run it, or should it finance or subsidize a school that is owned by an NGO? The property rights approach, pioneered by Grossman, Hart, and Moore (see Hart 1995), studies this questions in the context of private goods where the allocation of ownership affects incentives to undertake noncontractible relationship-specific investments Because these investments are not contractible, there is ex post bargaining over the surplus that they generate Ownership positively affects bargaining power because the owner can always threaten to fire the other party after investments have been sunk Therefore, the owner can extract a higher share of the surplus of the project, and this improves his investment incentives However, by the same token, it reduces the investment incentives for the other party Therefore, according to this theory, the party whose investment is more important for the project should be the owner In particular, if"}

According to some advocates of school competition and vouchers, such as Hoxby (2001), the answer is yes Competition from private organizations can induce public organizations to get their act together in order to hold on to funding and to their clientele—competition is a tide that raises all boats 12 Hoxby draws the parallel between this and the effect of entry of Federal Express and DHL into the package delivery market in the United States, which forced the U S Postal Service to improve quality, cut costs, and offer new products such as Express Mail Opponents argue that competition will lead to cream-skimming New schools will attract students from higher income and education groups As these students leave, taking with them the per capita government funding, poorer students in old schools will be strictly worse off However, this is not an argument against competition per se It merely calls for “smart” vouchers whose value depends on the socioeconomic background of the student, so as to make them attractive to new schools Also, competition in the context of public goods can take interesting forms For example, Besley and Ghatak (2003, 2005) argue that schools can be viewed as competing by picking different kinds of curriculum and attracting teachers who are most motivated to teach according to that curriculum One element of the curriculum could, for example, be whether religious instruction is included Well-matched schools can forgo incentive pay and rely exclusively on agents’ motivation This explains why some schools (such as Catholic schools) can be more productive by attracting teachers whose mission preferences are closely aligned with those of the school management More generally, a decentralized schooling system in which missions are developed at the school level will tend to be more productive (as measured in our model by equilibrium effort) than a centralized one in which a uniform curriculum (mission) is imposed on schools by government CONCLUSION We have argued in this essay that the standard public-private dichotomy is of limited use in thinking about institution design for public-goods provision The following news that hit the headlines recently highlights this starkly 13 On July 16, 2004, an illegal thatched"}

Curiously, and for all our intuition about the matter, the answer is not completely obvious, and requires some thinking In the mid-1970s, two economists, Tony Atkinson and Joe Stiglitz, derived a result that still confounds the advocates of targeted policy interventions They showed that under some conditions,14 all redistribution among economic agents should operate through a redistribution of income That is, however redistribution-minded the government is, it should refrain from subsidizing some goods and taxing others For example, governments should not “force” consumers to consume electricity or local telephone services (often subsidized services) by offering"}
{"id": 475, "text": "should not “force” consumers to consume electricity or local telephone services (often subsidized services) by offering them low prices The message and logic behind this result are straightforward make the distribution of income more equal,15 and let the consumers decide what they want to consume This result is useful for what it really is a benchmark that serves as a warning against unmotivated paternalistic preferences of governments, and for which departures are vindicated by welldocumented failures of the assumptions One of the strong assumptions underlying the sufficiency of income taxation is the perfect verifiability of income in practice, income tax is evaded in legal (perks, loopholes) and illegal ways, which suggests taxing goods and services mostly demanded by the rich more heavily To see why health is different from other goods and services, let us first take a look at rich countries There are several reasons why using health-related policies to redistribute may actually make sense despite the Atkinson and Stiglitz result (these reasons by and large also apply to education, which may explain why health and education are the two pillars of social democracy) First, health is an input into the production of income (this will be particularly so for poor countries) An alternative to income taxation as a means of redistributing income—and one that is less distortive of labor supply—is to make sure that access to health services is not too unequal Second, decisions relative to health are, in the case of children, made on behalf of the person, and not by the individual himself/herself there is thus a concern that some children are denied access to the treatments that they should receive Third, there are, in the case of vaccines, externalities Lo and behold, even the more market-oriented economies heavily regulate health care Price caps on medicines are widespread (with substantial variations, though for example, prices of on-patent drugs in the United States are about twice the French or Italian level) To be certain, the real motivation behind these regulations is often unrelated to the normative considerations just discussed rather, they reflect two less avowable political economy considerations First, the pharmaceutical industry has high fixed costs and low marginal costs, a situation that makes expropriation of investment through low prices, once the fixed costs have been sunk, quite tempting Second, and more specific to the international context, innovations are global public goods, and thus individual countries do not benefit from promising “fair prices” even if they can commit to them Indeed, each country has a private incentive to free-ride on other countries and pay as little as possible for these global public goods 16 Price regulation of patented drugs is a simple way to obtain this free ride An interesting case in point is the fall 2001 Cipro saga in the United States In the midst of the anthrax scare, Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson threatened Cipro manufacturer Bayer with compulsory licensing17 and forced it to slash prices (ironically, in the same way South Africa forced Merck, Bristol-Myers, and others to cut prices on AIDS treatments, generating"}
{"id": 476, "text": "same way South Africa forced Merck, Bristol-Myers, and others to cut prices on AIDS treatments, generating a protest from the American government) While everyone will agree that something would have gone wrong if the anthrax threat had proved to be widespread and if Bayer had jacked up prices so as to make Cipro unaffordable to a fraction of the American population, the U S government’s intervention raises questions about the pharmaceutical industry’s incentive to develop vaccines and drugs for future bioterrorism attacks Lowprobability events require large rewards to justify R D expenditures (To be sure, the problem is not specific to the pharmaceutical industry Take the power industry, in which prices may, even in the absence of exercise of market power, jump by a factor of 20 or 100 during peak time—a few hours or days during the year Price caps aimed at limiting economic rents during these peak hours are widely perceived as a disincentive to install or maintain peaking production facilities that operate optimally only a few days a year ) To sum up There is a legitimate (normative) argument in favor of using the health care system in order to redistribute And, given limited budgets, there is also a case for regulating drug prices so as to allow a more democratic access to drugs, although it must be recognized that such policies come at the cost of a lower innovation rate While price controls are probably better explained by the unavowable motives of (a) opportunistically expropriating pharmaceuticals once R D has been sunk and (b) free-riding on other countries, the normative side is still a key ingredient in these positive explanations, to the extent that it can explain why governments are given much larger discretion in the realm of pharmaceuticals than for other products under the TRIPS and other multilateral agreements The case for redistribution through health policies is stronger internationally Income redistribution is less developed across than within countries This of course is due to the selfishness of rich countries, which redistribute hardly anything to poor countries Selfishness, to be certain, is only part of the story First, the fight against poverty is itself a global public good, and so even a country with altruistic preferences may still prefer other countries to provide the global public good Second, it is by no means easy to ensure that income transfers reach the right people 18 Third, means-tested aid, like any other form of assistance, creates moral hazard Yet it is a safe bet that even if a multilateral agreement could be reached concerning rich countries’ contributions to world economic development and if solutions to the delivery problem could be found, rich countries’ generosity would still show its limits Historically, a substantial, although not very visible, share of the redistribution from rich to poor countries has operated through free (or low-price) IP transfers Technologies developed in rich countries reach poor countries, after a delay, when they go off-patent And on-patent technologies have in the past not been covered by IP protection, a situation that is modified by the TRIPS agreement,"}

The extent to which vaccines would lose their effectiveness over time Presumably, some ongoing monitoring of vaccine effectiveness in the field would be required, and if it appears that resistance to the vaccine is spreading, vaccine purchases would have to be reassessed Products that meet the technical requirements could then be subject to a market test nations wishing to purchase vaccines might be required to provide a modest copayment tied to their per capita income, so that countries would have an incentive to carefully investigate whether candidate vaccines are appropriate for their local conditions This provision would also help to assure that limited donor funds are allocated well and would increase incentives for developers by increasing the payment offered to the successful developer On the other hand, a copayment requirement could reduce the confidence of potential vaccine developers in the program by increasing the uncertainty of future vaccine demand in poor countries A purchase commitment could also include a system of bonus payments for products that exceed the minimum technical requirements PRODUCT PRICING AND COVERAGE After suitable eligibility requirements have been set and credibility has been established, the key determinant of research incentives for potential vaccine developers will be the total discounted revenue generated by a product It is very expensive to conduct R D, but once research is complete, it is typically fairly cheap to produce additional doses For a fixed amount of total revenue, product developers will therefore be almost as happy to produce a high volume at a low price as a low volume at a high price This implies that, at least as a first approximation, prices should be set per person immunized or treated, not per dose There is little reason to pay more per person immunized if more doses are required to provide immunity than if a single dose is required In fact, the vaccine is more valuable if only a single dose is required to provide immunity, since this reduces delivery costs and is likely to increase patient compliance Moreover, the purchase program would not save money by excluding large countries from coverage, or excluding countries if vaccination is cost-effective at the marginal cost of production but not at the average price paid under the program Such exclusions would be a false economy Because potential developers will need a fixed amount of revenue to induce them to conduct research, if fewer doses are purchased, the price per person immunized"}

{"id": 502, "text": "case for addressing risk The International Labour Organisation followed suit by taking the reduction of risk as a unifying theme in its work on social safety nets (as does the Bank’s own Social Protection Strategy Paper), and the UNDP has also jumped on board The challenges in reducing risk are great The lack of insurance markets has not happened through inattention, and hundreds of doctoral dissertations and other scholarly studies explain in careful detail why insurance markets remain so problematic Despite the generally strong markets of the United States, for example, 44 million poorer households had no health insurance in late 2004 And insurance for U S farmers exists largely because taxpayers have subsidized it at a rate of about $5 of subsidy for every $1 of insurance provided (Yaron et al 1997) Around the world, most poor people are farmers, and crop insurance faces the same fundamental difficulties as in the United States In the early 1990s, I spent parts of several summers in villages in Shandong province in northern China, investigating how poor households were coping with risk after the dramatic rural reforms that had started in 1978 The short answer to the question was “not too well ” While on average incomes were growing at 8% per year, a quarter of the population in any given year was suffering losses of about 20% (Morduch and Sicular 2001) This was mainly due to fluctuations in agriculture as households battled a range of plagues with biblical echoes drought, floods, hail, pest infestation, and livestock disease The state-owned People’s Insurance Company had been revived in the 1980s, but it provided agricultural insurance purely to appease policy makers, and the company’s lack of enthusiasm translated into miserly insurance coverage Farmers could not buy coverage against infestation of cotton by boll worms, for instance, despite their frequent appearance and destructiveness, and the maximum coverage for losses was 70 yuan per mu, although the cost of production was roughly 200 yuan per mu from planting to harvest 3 All the same, the company still suffered losses on its agricultural lines The Chinese experience has parallels globally experts whom I have canvassed have difficulty naming even one truly successful small-scale crop insurance program anywhere (i e , one that serves the poor, makes profits, and meaningfully reduces the largest risks) To make profits, insurers must pay out less than they take in as revenues, but Hazell (1992) finds the ratios of costs to revenue all well above breakeven levels (i e , 1 or below) in his studies of Brazil (4 6), Costa Rica (2 8), Japan (4 6), Mexico (3 7), and the United States (2 4) Most crop insurance, such as the People’s Insurance Company’s agricultural lines, is both subsidized and relatively ineffective Why do farmers have difficulty finding effective insurance? The problems are several, and a handful of Nobel Prizes in economics have been given to those who generated the key insights First, “moral hazard” is omnipresent once insured, farmers are less likely to apply the extra fertilizer, labor, and other inputs needed"}
{"id": 503, "text": "once insured, farmers are less likely to apply the extra fertilizer, labor, and other inputs needed to maximize chances of success the very fact of being insured raises the probability of losses Second, “adverse selection” arises since farmers in the riskiest situations are naturally the most eager to purchase insurance When insurers cannot tell beforehand who is most risky, they have to charge everyone the same price for insurance, but often that only ends up pushing “safer” farmers farther away If insurers lowered prices, they might be able to attract a better pool of clients, but profit margins will fall if the improvement in clients is less than proportional to the price drop This problem could be solved by charging different prices to different types of farmers, but the insurance company (at least at the outset) has little to go by when distinguishing the best prospects from the worst The third issue is analytically less interesting (and thus receives less attention from academics), but it is often critical in practice it’s hard for insurers to provide crop insurance in a cheap way, since contracts are generally for small amounts and damages have to be assessed by insurers on an individual basis scale economies are thus limited This all sounds grim transactions costs are high and information problems are ubiquitous—not to mention that clients have limited cash flows and may not be literate or numerate, and that enforcement mechanisms are limited Private-sector insurers naturally look elsewhere for profits, leaving state-subsidized companies as the main players—and even they are having a rough time of it But is it really as hopeless as it sounds? Despite the woeful litany, the characterization sounds a lot like the situation facing the “microfinance” industry in the 1980s—the early pioneers such as Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh’s Grameen Bank also faced great skepticism when arguing that it is possible to lend profitably to the poor Credit markets in poor regions, like insurance markets, are also characterized by similar problems of high transactions costs, moral hazard, adverse selection, limited cash flows, low education levels of clients, and weak enforcement mechanisms And in the case of credit, too, the main “formal” lenders also had too often been bloated, subsidized, ineffective state-owned companies But today, thanks to a series of clever innovations, microfinance is booming, and the Grameen Bank served 3 4 million clients in early 2004 (which is perhaps one quarter of all microfinance clients in Bangladesh) a 2003 tally puts the global total at over 80 million served—with rapid growth predicted by some advocates (DaleyHarris 2004) Marguerite Robinson (2001) has described an international “microfinance revolution ” Can the “microinsur-ance revolution” be far behind?

{"id": 506, "text": "swings, but not how this was achieved Lim and Townsend (1998) instead sift through the data to find the specific ways that households are actually coping The biggest part of the answer is that the action is not via informal community-based sharing after all It is through individuals building up grain reserves and drawing them down as needed (a sort of in-kind saving) It is self-insurance And this, coupled with the new evidence on imperfect informal insurance, radically changes the policy picture It suggests the need to pay attention to idiosyncratic risk along with regionwide risk, and it points to the strengthening of opportunities to save as an important policy area Interpreting results on imperfect insurance is not easy Townsend (1994) had asked a sharp question and gotten a sharp answer (even if it proved not to be entirely robust), but subsequent analyses are open to multiple interpretations Take the interesting result of Jalan and Ravallion (1999) from China, for example they show that on average 40% of idiosyncratic income shocks are translated into consumption shocks for the poorest households in a large longitudinal survey conducted between 1985 and 1990 This is an important result, confirming the vulnerability of the poor in a large non-Indian data set But the average is hard to parse, and the result admits various possibilities Is it that all poor households are vulnerable to 40% of shocks? Or can, say, half in fact fully insure while the other half suffers 80% of the loss? Or is it something in between? Are positive shocks handled very differently from negative shocks? Are protections achieved through borrowing and saving? Through community-based informal insurance? Perhaps more important, the studies after Townsend, including those from China, don’t tell us about how well households deal with aggregate risk Putting concern back onto the idiosyncratic risks of individual villagers was a step forward, but researchers are now at risk of losing track of aggregate, regionwide risks in the process (Townsend’s method remains mute on the impact of shocks facing an entire region) We have bits of evidence on the impacts of droughts and floods and other major disasters, but studying periods of upheaval, with its attendant migration and dislocation, is hard in practice it is also difficult to separate out the impact of an aggregate shock from other contemporaneous changes So, where should researchers go? From a policy perspective, ideally we would like to know probabilities that losses will occur (and how great they will be)— whether they are due to aggregate or idiosyncratic forces—within a given number of months or years This is exactly what Gisele Kamanou, a Berkeley-trained statistician at the United Nations, and I set out to do in defining a framework to measure vulnerability in a way that might guide policy in Africa, but we quickly ran up against data issues (Kamanou and Morduch 2004) We used the data set with the greatest coverage of people (a World Bank survey from the Ivory Coast), but it tracked households for just two successive years With two years of data, forecasting risk"}
{"id": 507, "text": "but it tracked households for just two successive years With two years of data, forecasting risk thus became impossible without heroic assumptions But to see how far we could get, we pushed on As we did so, however, the data proved to be noisy in ways that were particularly pernicious measurement error was impossible to disentangle from actual fluctuations in income and consumption The very poorest households as judged in the first year had huge increases in income by the second (+ 50%), and the very richest in the first year had what seemed like big losses (–30%) Perhaps we were seeing a spectacular case of what statisticians and geneticists call “reversion to the mean,” but it seemed more likely that we were seeing a spectacular case of measurement error The pattern we saw was consistent, for example, with the income of the “poorest” in the first year being severely undercounted (making for a big jump to a more accurate figure in year 2), while that of the “rich” was severely overcounted at first To understand how vulnerable households really are, we need longer, cleaner data series But policy makers should not hold their breath while waiting The experience with microfinance suggests that there is no need to despair Muhammad Yunus, for example, did not wait until he had all the answers before he set up the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh But once it was set up, the introduction of the bank provided a way to learn about credit markets by comparing outcomes in places served by Grameen versus outcomes in control villages (Morduch 1998) As a result, we are now learning about the nature of credit markets in ways impossible before microfinance was established So too, I expect, with microinsurance The best hope is that microinsurance implementers will forge ahead with pilot projects, and that, if they are carefully rolled out (with an eye to evaluations), a great deal about risk, vulnerability, and poverty can be learned in the process THINKING ABOUT LIFE INSURANCE Let’s return to the scene on the ground Before getting to crop insurance and health insurance, take a moment to consider life insurance If you support a family, one of the greatest fears is that one day you will no longer be alive to do so From your family’s perspective, your death will surely bring emotional and economic loss— and, more immediately, high funeral costs Demand for life insurance among the poor is thus considerable Neither moral hazard nor adverse selection is nearly as problematic here as it is for crop and health insurance (Would you be more likely to walk to the very edge of a precipice or to take up a pack-a-day smoking habit just because you have a life insurance policy in the drawer?), and verifying the loss is straightforward either there was a death or there wasn’t (To further allay moral hazard, insurers typically exclude death from suicide, driving while intoxicated, and illegal activity ) So here, at least, we would expect to see private insurance companies jostling their way into the market"}
{"id": 508, "text": "at least, we would expect to see private insurance companies jostling their way into the market But we don’t, at least not yet 7 Instead, to the extent that we see any action, it is informal, community-based arrangements without legal status, operating below the radar screen of the formal economy Stuart Rutherford (2000), for example, describes burial societies in the fishing communities of Cochin, India The societies are typically based around a church, temple, mosque, or social club, and each involves 300 people or more In a typical fund, each member contributes at least 2 rupees per week (about 4 cents) For each rupee per week contributed, the society guarantees that if a member of the contributor’s family dies within the year (with exclusions for infants and partial exclusions for young children), the family gets Rs 500 (about $10) from the fund Since the fund is taking in at least Rs 600 per week (or about Rs 300,000 over fifty weeks), the fund can cover deaths of at least thirty people If each family has four adults (or their equivalent), there are at least 1,200 individual lives being insured, and the fund covers costs as long as no more than 5% of participants die in any given year in typical years surpluses are generated and redistributed to members, but in other years extra collections are made This kind of burial society can be found worldwide, but the security comes at a high price for relatively healthy households Each family puts in at least Rs 100 rupees over the year (two rupees per week over fifty weeks), and the family gets Rs 1,000 if an adult dies To be a “fair” bet, the family would thus have to reckon that there is a 10% chance that an adult in their family will die in any given year (assuming that the fund exactly breaks even) If the probability is much lower, the family would be better off simply putting the money into the bank To put the probability in perspective, the 10% figure implies that participants believe there is roughly a 30% chance that an adult in the family will die within three years—and roughly a 50% chance that an adult will die within six years For a household with elderly members, these odds may not be far off, but for a young family (absent the threat of killers such as AIDS), the odds are wildly unfavorable Nevertheless, burial societies remain widely popular Partly their popularity comes from the fact that most people have a hard time thinking straight about probabilities This was most famously demonstrated by the experimental psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, who found that attitudes toward risk depend critically on how questions are framed (Kahneman et al 1982) Hospital patients will show more interest in undergoing radical surgery when told that there is, say, an 80% survival rate versus when told that there is a 20% chance of dying—even though the two scenarios are, of course, just different ways of saying the exact same thing And even if people think"}
{"id": 509, "text": "of course, just different ways of saying the exact same thing And even if people think consistently, there is typically a lot of uncertainty about survival probabilities, not to mention the fact that calculations can get complicated quickly (to check the calculations for the simple example in the preceding paragraph, I used a computer spreadsheet program) On top of it all is uncertainty about one’s general economic situation in the future, the ability to get public handouts and private charity, and so on Add in emotional elements, and it becomes clear why even young, healthy families seem highly risk averse when they take “bets” on life insurance The continuing mystery, again, is why private companies don’t edge their way into this market Compared with operations attached to the local church or mosque, private companies have far better opportunities to diversify risks and to offer a range of products, helping to cut effective costs and to increase quality for clients Here, the example from Cochin helps to make another point that gets us closer to the answer burial societies handle a lot of small change the equivalent of 4 cents a week, collected from each of three hundred families Burial societies can operate this way because they are based out of local institutions where people already gather weekly the societies can thus collect small payments as part of other activities But an insurance company, coming from outside, lacks that advantage (not to mention lacking a reputation that in-surees can trust) Insurance companies typically collect insurance premiums one-by-one, and given the costs of record-keeping and staff salaries, 4 cents a week per household looks like very small change indeed 8 In China, the People’s Insurance Company cleverly addressed the small-change problem by setting up deposit accounts for purchasers of certain kinds of insurance— but instead of receiving interest, the depositors got insurance coverage The PIC was able to do this because farmers were already used to having savings deposits and most were experiencing fast income growth But consider the Cochin case again If the insurance company earns, say, 5% per year on its deposits, depositors would need to put in Rs 2,000 to generate Rs 100 of annual premiums for the insurer While Rs 2,000 is just $40, it is a lot of money for a poor household to have up front and to tie up in a “nonproductive” investment (bearing in mind that the insurance payout in the event of death is just $10) The deposit-cum-insurance scheme deserves wider application, but it will likely be a hard sell in the poor neighborhoods of Cochin Another option is to have insurees pay premiums less frequently (16 cents per month? 50 cents per quarter?), and this will work if the insurer’s cost structure is low enough and insurees can save up reasonably well Saving is not so easy, though, and if the solution was really as simple as collecting premiums less frequently, my guess is that we would currently see a lot more private life insurance Stuart Rutherford, the founder and chairman of Dhaka’s SafeSave"}
{"id": 510, "text": "see a lot more private life insurance Stuart Rutherford, the founder and chairman of Dhaka’s SafeSave cooperative, has written a helpful volume, The Poor and Their Money, which describes the ubiquity of savings difficulties through example after example of informal attempts to overcome them (Rutherford 2000) the theme of savings constraints is developed as a main theme of Armendariz de Aghion and Morduch (2005) One hope is to pay local agents a small commission to collect funds and check claims As microfinance institutions are starting to recognize, they are often already in this niche, and the emerging microinsurance movement is closely allied to the established microfinance movement The most popular insurance product offered by microfinance institutions is credit life insurance For a percentage of each loan, the bank will pay off any debt outstanding in case of death (plus, often, a bit extra for the family) This insurance mainly helps the lenders, and it turns out to be profitable, given the infrequency of death As of several years ago, FINCA Uganda, for example, charged an additional interest rate of 0 5% per month for credit life insurance, with a $630 payout in the event of accidental death FINCA’s partner, the American Insurance Group, was enjoying a profit rate of 30% at these prices Of course, access is permitted only if you’re in a microfinance program The ongoing challenge here is to provide wider access to life insurance, as well as to health, property, and crop insurance HEALTH INSURANCE FOCUSING ON THE BIGGEST RISKS There is a movement afoot to provide health insurance, and the model of the SelfEmployed Women’s Association (SEWA) of Ahmedabad, India, is one of the most discussed SEWA has been ambitious in the health care that it provides its members, who are typically poor women working in the informal sector, but it has had difficulty covering costs The problem with providing health insurance is that both moral hazard and adverse selection are rife NGO practitioners pushing forward here are finding two problems First, the risks can be sizable, so a large, established partner is invaluable to provide reinsurance Second, historical data on health risks are inadequate to yield insurance premiums with much accuracy Microinsurers thus see the value of their new endeavors at the same time they see how easily they could lose their shirts if they’ve guessed wrong about risk levels and costs As a result, putting caps on coverage is nearly universal, as is excluding coverage of particularly expensive health conditions FINCA Uganda’s health plan, for example, covered a range of in-patient and out-patient services but chose to exclude ongoing coverage of AIDS-related illnesses The impulse to cap payouts is understandable it reduces the insurer’s exposure to risk, and this will surely calm jittery accountants The other fairly common practice is to cover expenses starting with the first dollar spent 9 It is popular with clients, but can lead to lots of costly, small claims that insurees could typically handle without insurance Moreover, to reduce moral hazard, economic theory tells us that insurers should insist on sizable"}
{"id": 511, "text": "insurance Moreover, to reduce moral hazard, economic theory tells us that insurers should insist on sizable copayments and deductibles Coverage from the first dollar spent too easily leads to wasteful overuse The use of caps also does not sit particularly well with the economic theory of the household To make insurance most valuable, the theory suggests that an enlightened manager would want to do the opposite to cover the expenses that are really big and exclude the small items The priority ought to be on costs that would cripple a household—that is, priority should go to insurance against “catastrophic” events So why isn’t economic theory more persuasive? The microinsurers that I have spoken to suggest that if they don’t give “first dollar” coverage, people will wait until their problems become severe before going to the doctor This hardly makes sense, unless clients are very ill-informed about the nature of their problems If that’s so (and Das and Das 2001 provide interesting evidence from India suggesting that it’s not far-fetched), it is possible that firstdollar coverage actually saves money by encouraging preventive treatment A better solution, though, would be to improve public information about health conditions and the importance of prevention Another often-heard defense of “first dollar” coverage is that clients want to get something back for the money they spend on insurance At the end of the year, for example, new clients sometimes demand their money back if they haven’t had to use a doctor within the year This is a marketing problem, and should not be used to justify the dubious practice of “firstdollar” coverage On the other hand, the idea of rebating some money to clients who have made no claims within a period isn’t bad (in fact, that’s the way some U S insurers create positive incentives for clients) Another issue is reinsurance Catastrophic events are costly but usually rare, and an unexpected cluster of large claims can wipe out an insurer (whereas it may be able to handle a steady stream of small claims capped at low levels on its own) Moving to insurance against catastrophic events requires that the insurer have a way to handle potentially large losses The best way to do that is by reinsuring through arrangements with other insurers (paying another company to share some of the risk) This requires some sophistication, but it is not conceptually difficult and there are signs that reinsurers are becoming interested in relationships in low-income countries (partly to diversify their own portfolios of activities) Another set of issues arises with the ability to pay for health insurance If households suffered only from a clear set of readily identifiable and insurable risks, designing appropriate coverage could follow textbook rules But a major problem for the poor is that (1) many risks are not insurable (such as the risk that farmers will suffer falling crop prices) and (2) bad news tends to come in waves This has two implications First, customers may be particularly price-sensitive when it comes to buying insurance Not because they ignore health problems, but because they"}
{"id": 512, "text": "price-sensitive when it comes to buying insurance Not because they ignore health problems, but because they don’t want to tie up scarce funds by paying insurance premiums This makes the ability to save an important way to self-insure, and I come back to this at the end of the essay The second implication is that uninsurable risks may drag households down, pushing them to the point at which it’s impossible to keep paying premiums for health insurance Most programs cut off coverage for households not in good standing, which means that even after paying premiums regularly for years, the household is left to fend for itself once it gets behind in its payments If a household then faces a health crisis, it is doubly hit since it must contend both with the original (uninsurable) loss and the fact that its health problems are no longer covered One way to address this problem is to create an emergency loan and grant fund that is earmarked for households with a history of reliable insurance payments but a current demonstrated emergency The bottom line is that providing health insurance (particularly against catastrophic events) can reduce the vulnerability of low-income households in important ways, just as it does for higher-income households But in this population especially, insurance may not be enough on its own Coupling insurance with health education and an emergency fund to cover temporary nonhealth crises can make insurance more effective for clients and providers alike INSURING RAINFALL A NEW SOLUTION TO AN OLDPROBLEM Providing life and health insurance will help reduce vulnerability, but when it comes to rural risk, agriculture is where it’s at Existing microfinance institutions, though, focus mainly on urban or rural nonagricultural enter-prises—conspicuously not on agricultural ones Microfinance participation may reduce risk for farm households by allowing them to diversify their income sources (evidence showing this is presented in Morduch 1998), but microfinance institutions are far from being in a position to do much about crops and rural risks directly Falling crop prices can hit poor farmers hard, as can bad weather We turn here to the latter problem Insuring farmers against generic crop losses has turned out to be full of difficulties for reasons cited already (high transactions costs, moral hazard, and adverse selection) Recently, though, policy makers are rethinking their options Why not abandon trying to insure against bad crop yields and instead insure against bad weather directly? While Hurricane Mitch brought too much rain, a more common fear in Central America is in fact the opposite drought So why not create a product that pays out in the case of drought, irrespective of actual crop yields? The beauty of such drought insurance is that the insurance company pays clients when rainfall (as measured at a local weather station) fails to reach specified targets (see Hazell n d Skees et al 2004) Since rainfall is determined by higher powers than those commanded by the typical client, client behavior and client characteristics have no bearing on the probability of adverse events Insurance executives can thus sleep at night without"}

{"id": 514, "text": "the less useful rainfall insurance is to potential clients (although, on the other hand, an insurer’s portfolio gets more diversified) There are two forces that combine to create basis risk First, the local rainfall gauge may simply be too far away to provide data relevant to conditions throughout the region This can be solved in principle by putting up more rainfall gauges, but that’s the easy part The harder part is to set premiums To do that, the insurer needs to know gauge-specific probabilities of risk, and this requires having historical data on rainfall patterns for every gauge Lack of disaggregated historical data on rainfall patterns turns out to be an important constraint in Nicaragua, and it is not exceptional the constraints imposed by basis risk and missing data have helped push rainfall insurance to the back burner in much of the world The sooner efforts to collect better data can begin, the better In Morocco, on the other hand, a World Bank study found more promising results Moroccan agriculture is based on cereals, and the correlation between cereal revenues and rainfall was found to be 60%–80% Since the incidence of drought and overall GDP growth move closely in Morocco, the World Bank hopes that addressing weather risk will ultimately affect economic growth rates Based in large part on the Morocco study, the World Bank’s International Financial Corporation invested $80 million in 2002 to establish a Global Weather Risk Facility in partnership with Aquila, a Kansas City-based trader in weather-based derivatives (World Bank 2002) Rainfall insurance will now get a trial run, and we will be able to track its impacts RAINFALL INSURANCE FROM THE POPULATION’S PERSPECTIVE The establishment of the Global Weather Risk Facility provides hope for many farmers But it is not the end of the road First, it is mainly a pilot project Second, the analysis of microinsurance here has mainly concerned constraints and opportunities for insurers only But it is happy, healthy customers who are of ultimate concern, not just happy, healthy insurers We need to step back and think about society’s welfare more broadly We have taken it as a given that more insurance is necessarily a good thing But we need to ask whether that’s in fact true for everyone in all circumstances—and if it’s not, what can policy makers do about it? Some of the most important aspects of insurance will be indirect The first important indirect impact of rainfall insurance involves possible changes in the pattern and level of consumer prices It’s useful to turn to Amartya Sen’s (1981) work on the Great Bengal Famine for an analogy He describes how the famine resulted from price increases faced by poor households—in a situation where food availability was not low enough to create famine conditions by itself Price increases typically particularly harm landless laborers and other net consumers As a result, landless laborers are often the ones worst off in droughts Will introducing rainfall insurance improve their lots—or possibly worsen them?

{"id": 515, "text": "worsen them? An advantage of rainfall insurance over crop insurance is that now landless laborers have the possibility of purchasing insurance against drought, something that’s impossible when only crop insurance is being sold If they buy rainfall insurance, landless laborers will have added purchasing power in times of crisis This should be a great advantage The flip side is that landless laborers may not have access to rainfall insurance (or an equivalent) this may be because prices for premiums are too high for households with inadequate cash flows, marketing is ineffective, or, as I found in Nicaragua, insurers are reluctant to sell directly to individuals, preferring to reduce transactions costs by selling through established groups and associations In this case, the landless poor could be made substantially worse off by the introduction of rainfall insurance Now farmers (who are insured) will have added purchasing power to bid up prices for whatever food and services are available in the market during the drought The price increases will further diminish the lot of the landless The landless can thus be made worse off relative to a world without rainfall insurance In short, rainfall insurance has very positive elements, but if it is not accompanied by other measures for the poor, it can exacerbate losses for some of the most vulnerable populations The magnitude of costs and benefits of rainfall insurance is an empirical question, and there is no a priori reason to assume the worst But there is an a priori reason to be careful about distributional effects Let’s also go back to the initial claim that rainfall insurance banishes concerns about moral hazard and adverse selection This is certainly so from the perspective of the provider of rainfall insurance But, if we look closer, it’s not so from a global perspective introducing rainfall insurance can improve or worsen moral hazard and adverse selection in other markets For example, provision of rainfall insurance could make other informal risksharing arrangements work less well Consider, say, neighbors agreeing to help each other out in times of need Informal insurance in this example is characterized by the inability to write binding, enforceable long-term contracts Instead, the arrangements stay together only as long as the expected value of staying true to the arrangement exceeds the value of reneging and facing risk alone (i e , self-insuring) The arrangements weaken when the self-insurance option improves 11 Rainfall insurance can hurt by improving the fallback position for those who renege on their obligations and are thus left to their own devices (which, lucky for them, would now include buying rainfall insurance) Of course, partially displacing informal arrangements by introducing rainfall insurance here could, on net, be a good thing, but there will inevitably be winners and losers (Morduch 1999a) There is no empirical evidence yet that speaks to the magnitude of these kinds of spillovers, but they are there in principle, and we should be mindful As rainfall insurance moves into view, it’s important to see what it can do and what it can’t No one thinks it’s a panacea,"}

{"id": 523, "text": "resorting to forecasts or simple extrapolations from the experience of other countries, however, we base these results on a firm understanding of what happened to Thailand in its past Using a simple economic model, we can understand Thailand’s remarkable growth from 1976 to 1996, at 6% on average, and much higher in the second part of this twenty-year period, a growth rate driven in no small part by expansion of financial infrastructure, that is, by improved intermediation If, contrary to what actually happened, that expansion had been far more limited, virtually zero, then the model predicts that Thailand would not have grown much at all The best that can be managed is a low and flat 2% per year, and that is driven by an overestimate of total factor productivity (TFP) gains in agriculture at 4% per year The observed increase in the GDP growth rate (net of TFP growth), from the mid- to late 1980s on into the early 1990s, at 8%–10% per year, can be reconciled in the model only by imagining a domestic savings rate at astoundingly high levels However, if we progressively allow the population access to competitive financial intermediaries at exactly the rate observed in Thai data, with its surges from 10% with access in the mid-1980s to 20% by the mid-1990s, then we can track the upturn in the Thai growth rate reasonably well More generally, the model is able to reproduce the movements of key macroeconomic variables such as the labor share, savings rate, income inequality, and the fraction of entrepreneurs observed in Thailand during the past two decades Indeed, with the understanding of Thailand’s historical experience that the artificial model economy provides, we can ask who gained from the observed financial sector expansion We address this issue by comparing two versions of Thailand’s history from 1976 to 1996, the actual one and a counterfactual one with a policy distortion that limits financial intermediation The results confirm that not everyone benefits equally from the financial expansion In 1978, for example, the modal gain from enhanced intermediation was between 5,000 baht and 17,000 baht per household, measured in 1997 domestic currency (the numbers depend on the specific estimation procedure used) Under the former exchange rate, this is equivalent to $200 to $680 per household for that year Relative to average income, these numbers represent a 14% to 41% increase in the levels of income in 1978, a surprisingly high increment Moreover, relatively low-wealth households that managed to switch occupations and go into business gained the most—the welfare numbers would be even higher if we used the simple arithmetic average By 1996 the wage was roughly 60% higher than it would have been without the expansion Such price movements help determine the distribution of welfare gains and losses attributable to the financial sector expansion The bottom line is that there were still substantial winners in 1996 The modal increase in welfare was 25,000 baht, approximately 26% of 1997 average household annual income, equivalent to $1,000 With the wage increase, unskilled laborers employed by business also gained However,"}

Esther Duflo Modern development economics emerged with the realization that poverty changes the set of options available to individuals Poverty thus affects behavior, even if the decision maker is “neoclassical” unboundedly rational, forward-looking, and internally consistent The Homo economicus at the core of neoclassical economics (“calculating, unemotional maximizer” [Mullainathan and Thaler 2000]) would behave differently if he were poor than if he were rich Asset market failures and preferences toward risk are sufficient to explain why asset ownership matters, why worthwhile transactions and investments may not always take place, and why the poor may remain poor as a result The initial theoretical advances opened a new empirical agenda to mainstream economists 1 Prior to these advances, the debate revolved around the phrase “poor but efficient,” popularized by Ted Schultz (1964) According to this concept, the poor certainly have bad lives, but there is nothing special about them they just do the best they can under the difficult circumstances in which life has placed them and their fields are as productive as possible (Tax 1953)—they just cannot be very productive Rejecting (or accepting) the hypothesis of “poor but efficient” meant rejecting (or accepting) all the postulates of neoclassical economics When the theoretical work made it clear that being poor meant being cut off from many opportunities that were available to others, the task of empirical economics shifted to providing evidence for market inefficiencies and the potential of economic policies to alleviate them A new paradigm, “poor but neoclassical” (but not necessarily efficient) helped define an empirical agenda and structure a vision of the world, even though it often remained implicit in empirical work While the poor (and the rich) are all perfectly rational, the markets, left to themselves, may not produce an efficient outcome In turn, many of the predictions of this body of work have been substantiated by the data But there are also some fundamental facts for which this view of the world does not account Using two classic examples, which have been very fertile ground for research in development economics—insurance and agricultural investment—I will try to explore how far this agenda has led us, and what remains out of its reach INSURANCE The poor, it is commonly acknowledged, face a very risky environment the weather"}

How to prevent people who know they are insured from taking unreasonable risks, now that they are not going to pay for it? How to avoid a situation where only people who know they may encounter problems in the future sign up for insurance? In a village, part of the risk is common to all families if there is a really severe drought, it affects everyone But part of the risk is specific to the circumstances of specific households for example, someone’s cow may die This has made the village institution a fertile testing ground for one of the “poor but efficient” hypothesis within a village, the poor should be able to insure each other against the part of the risk that is common across households Townsend (1994) made this point in a very influential article Using detailed data from several Indian villages, he argued that the incomes of families within a village have ups and downs at very different times This creates substantial scope for insurance, and Townsend argued that advantage was fully taken of this possibility The consumption of all families within a village moves very close together when someone has a bad year, everybody in the village suffers a little bit, and the affected family’s consumption does not fall behind that of others This all goes to show, the article argued, that the village institution is fully efficient The article generated very lively controversy, and the question of how well rural households cope with risk and insure each other was a focus of much of the research in development economics in the following years Taking stock after ten years, it appears relatively clear that the claim made in the seminal Townsend paper gave somewhat too much credit to the village institution Subsequent work by Townsend himself (Townsend 1995a, 1995b), as well as others, recognized the incompleteness of the insurance provided in the village, and the variety of insurance arrangements across villages There are several reasons why insurance may be imperfect even in the village economy First, villagers may be able to hide part of their output from others Second, if efforts cannot be perfectly monitored, perfect insurance might result in disastrous outcomes if household members stop working in anticipation of being bailed out if and when their"}

This is exactly what we find If the year is good for women in a particular household, more money is spent on food than in good years for men In fact, none of the unexpected increase in the income from the male cash crops (coffee and cocoa) is spent on extra food all of it is spent on private goods (clothing, alcohol, and tobacco) This is particularly striking, since none of the information we used in our analysis was unknown to the household members We used only the information on the weather, which everybody in the household could observe The household members seem not to insure each other against variation in income that they can perfectly observe Furthermore, the household members do not seem to have an option of just leaving the household as a villager leaves the informal insurance arrangement, since they are linked by an intricate web of exchange (the women prepare food, the men bring in cash income, etc ), so that it is somewhat difficult to take as given the explanation that intrahousehold insurance arrangements are limited by the threat of walking away And finally, household members have strong sanctions at their disposal, which could potentially help them enforce efficient transfers The study in Côte d’Ivoire adds one more piece of evidence that further undermines the hope of finding an explanation for household behavior in a “poor but neoclassical” framework There is one crop in Côte d’Ivoire, yam, that is traditionally grown only by men (some specific operations cannot be accomplished by women, and property rights on yam fields and yam crops are clearly attributed to males) However, a strong social norm limits the legitimate uses of the proceeds from yams (Meillassoux 1964) Yams are supposed to be used for feeding household members and for taking care of children We therefore treated yams as a separate group and examined how expenditure on various goods"}
{"id": 530, "text": "children We therefore treated yams as a separate group and examined how expenditure on various goods reacted to variation in yam income predicted by rainfall Good years for yams are indeed associated with more expenditure on food, both purchased and eaten at home Expenditures on private goods (alcohol, tobacco, ornamental clothing, and jewelry) do not respond at all to increases or decreases in yam income Expenditure on education responds only to changes in yam income, not to changes in female or male income Men seem to treat income from different sources differently and do not use the windfall from one source to compensate for any shortfall from the other source The household therefore seems to keep separate “mental accounts” (Thaler 1994), treating different types of income differently The separation of accounts goes beyond the failure to put together money that “belongs” to different people different sources of income are allocated to different uses depending on their origin The fact that these accounts respond differently to observable shocks in income is difficult to reconcile with imperfect observability, moral hazard, or limits on self-enforcing insurance schemes The complexity of intrahousehold sharing arrangements seems to resist explanations based only on information and incentives Understanding why these norms and arrangements emerge (which problems they solve) and how they are sustained requires a deeper understanding of decision-making of individuals and groups It will also shed some light on how important economic decisions are made and what constraints are put on the household AGRICULTURAL INVESTMENT The classic articulation of the “poor but efficient” hypothesis for agricultural households is in the book by Schultz (1964), which argues that poor peasants are on the productive efficiency frontier, citing notably the study by Tax (1953), Penny Capitalism, which studies peasants in Guatemala If agricultural production is efficient, the investment, effort, and production on the land should not depend on who is tilling it whoever is working on the land should extract the maximum from the land, and these profits should then be shared The impact of tenancy arrangements on agricultural investment and productivity suggests that the story is more complicated For instance, Shaban (1987) showed that in India a given farmer works 40% more and uses 20% more fertilizer on his own land than on land that he is sharecropping Even after accounting for intrinsic differences in productivity of different plots of land, agricultural productivity is 30% higher on land farmed by the owner Tenancy arrangements are clearly inefficient The notion of limited liability provides a possible unified framework to explain why sharecropping arrangements arise, and why they are inefficient (Banerjee et al , 2002) If there is a limit on how miserable someone can be (e g , in no circumstance can someone’s last bowl of food be taken away), a tenant has to be protected in bad years, and thus his payment cannot be fully dependent on how well he did Limited liability also explains why those who do not have land cannot borrow to purchase it, and thus why there are tenants and landlords in the first place"}
{"id": 531, "text": "borrow to purchase it, and thus why there are tenants and landlords in the first place It implies that land or wealth redistribution would increase investments and productivity The poor are different because they are desperate (Banerjee 2001) Having nothing to lose, they cannot be made fully responsible for their actions They thus cannot be given the same opportunities as others, and this explains the persistence of poverty In this world, productivity should be maximal on owner-occupied land, at least when the necessary investments are not larger than the maximum an individual can borrow Since land can serve as collateral, maximum permissible borrowing should be related to the value of the land Very large investments (such as digging a new irrigation well) may not take place, even if they would eventually be profitable for a single farmer,2 but the choice of seeds, the use of fertilizer, the use of bullocks, and so forth should be efficient This intuition seems at odds with a number of facts sharing the feature that the technology employed on owner-occupied farms seems to be far from the most efficient For example, Goldstein and Udry (1999) show that the rate of return to growing pineapples greatly exceeds that of growing any of the other crops that are traditionally planted by farmers it is 531% for growing pineapple, while it is only 21% for growing traditional crops Yet only 24 4% of male farmers, and almost none of the female farmers, grow pineapple This is surprising, since pineapple growing requires a moderate initial investment that could easily be covered by a loan secured by the land owned by these farmers It is true that any new investment requires taking some risk that the poor may be wary of facing For example, in India, Morduch (1993, 1995) documents that poor farmers are less likely than richer farmers to use the high yielding varieties of seeds One possible explanation is that farmers are reluctant to borrow, perhaps for fear of losing their land if the investment does not pay off They will prefer a safe strategy with a low return to a riskier strategy with a higher return It is reasonable to think that the poorer someone is, the more he dislikes taking risks In that case, the poor (and sometimes even more so the near-poor, who have more to lose) will tend to be more conservative than the rich, and more likely to fail to undertake efficient investments In particular, small owners may be very reluctant to use their land to secure a mortgage This is poverty as vulnerability (Banerjee 2001) Again, this means that the poor will tend to remain poor, while those who start with enough wealth will be able to accumulate more of it According to Morduch, this accounts for the discrepancies in hybrid seed use across rich and poor farmers those who have access to assets that can safeguard their consumption are more likely to use fertilizers and hybrid seeds 3 There remain many facts that resist either of these views of the world To clarify"}
{"id": 532, "text": "3 There remain many facts that resist either of these views of the world To clarify the discussion, I will focus on one example that I have been studying for a few years in collaboration with Michael Kremer and Jonathan Robinson fertilizer use in western Kenya Corn is one of the main staple cereals in the region, and most farmers grow it on their own fields, mainly for home consumption There are still periodic food shortages in this region, so increasing agricultural productivity is critical On experimental farms, chemical fertilizers have been shown to generate very large increases in yield, and are recommended by the Agricultural Ministry as part of a package including hybrid seeds, fertilizer at planting, and fertilizer at “top dressing” (when the plant is knee-high) While commercial corn farmers in other regions of Kenya all use this package, in Busia (the region we study) less than 20% of farmers use fertilizer at any point in time Prima facie, neither limited liability nor risk aversion seems capable of explaining such a low level of fertilizer use Fertilizer comes in small packages, so it could be used on a very small part of the farmer’s land This would not require a large investment, so it seems implausible that the inability to borrow should be a major factor limiting investment For example, it costs 8 shillings, less than the price of 1 kilogram of corn, to apply fertilizer on an area of 30 square meters This is the average production of only 10 square meters of corn in a relatively bad season Even if there is no credit market, the farmer could always save during one season to start to use fertilizer the next season The size of the investment could be chosen so as to maintain the acceptable level of risk One obvious possibility is that fertilizer, while very effective on experimental farms and for commercial farmers who have access to mechanized agricultural tools, is actually not profitable for these farmers To investigate this, International Child Support (ICS), an NGO with a long-standing presence in the area, conducted small field trials on farmers’ lands During five consecutive seasons, ICS asked a group of farmers (randomly selected from the list of parents of students in several schools) to select two or three small contiguous plots of land (each measuring 30 or 60 square meters) A field officer then randomly selected one plot to be a control plot, and the others to be subjected to different “treatments” (fertilizer at top-dressing only, or the full “package” of hybrid seeds, fertilizer at planting and top-dressing) Because the recommendations on how much fertilizer to use were conflicting, ICS also varied the quantity of fertilizer applied on a given plot from season to season The field officer monitored fertilizer application and measured yields in treatment and control plots, but did not provide any other inputs or instructions, so that these results should reflect the profitability of using a given quantity of fertilizer under regular conditions The average (annualized) rate of return of applying a small quantity of"}
{"id": 533, "text": "fertilizer under regular conditions The average (annualized) rate of return of applying a small quantity of fertilizer at top-dressing was very large 231%, on average, over six seasons With larger quantities on the same sized plot, the average rate of return went down The experiments are too coarse to tell us what is the optimal quantity of fertilizer to use, but it seems clear that it is positive The full package recommended by the Ministry of Agriculture, however, had low or negative returns (-86% over two seasons) the reason was that, under real conditions, hybrid seeds often do not germinate and need to be replaced In this case, the initial investment in fertilizer at planting is lost The experiments thus taught us that it is clearly efficient for these farmers to use some fertilizer on their land However, they also showed that even though the technology has been around for a long time, what to use and how to use it are not necessarily effectively conveyed to the farmers This may open an avenue to rescue the hypothesis that lack of access to credit prevents fertilizer use Learning about a technology requires some experimentation, which requires effort, and presumably some losses in the first years (Foster and Rosenzweig 1995) If the farmer knows that after this initial investment he will be able to use fertilizer on only a very small scale for a long period of time (because he cannot have access to the funds to do it on a large scale), he might rightly consider it worthless to make the initial investment to master the technology The field trials allowed us to directly evaluate the strength of this hypothesis in essence, they constituted a particularly intensive form of agricultural extension After the harvest, an ICS field officer visited each farmer, and discussed his experience as well as the experience of everybody who participated in the trials with him The field officer went through detailed profit calculations, using both the farmer’s own data and the average numbers The farmers thus learned both how to use fertilizer and how profitable it really was ICS gave the farmers a chance to learn how to use fertilizer at no cost to them If learning how to use fertilizer was the main barrier to adoption, we might thus expect that farmers participating in the trials would have higher fertilizer use than those who did not Since farmers were randomly selected from parents of students in a few schools, the parents of other children in the same schools formed a natural comparison group We thus monitored the adoption of fertilizer by all farmers who had participated in ICS trials for the following seasons Indeed, fertilizer adoption increased in this group On average, while 20% of the farmers who did not participate in the trial adopted fertilizer in a given season, 37% of those who did participate were using fertilizer The explanation in terms of fixed costs of learning may thus have some bite, but fails to explain the entire phenomenon First, more than 60% of the farmers"}

Were farmers particularly aware of the value of fertilizer, after we had just weighed and valued the output of the two plots, and would this have lost its salience if the farmers had waited longer before having to decide whether or not to use fertilizer? Many further experiments will be necessary to disentangle these possibilities, and, with ICS, we are currently designing and implementing some of them What is clear, however, is that the inefficiently low level of fertilizer investment in this region cannot easily be accounted for by the “poor but neoclassical” paradigm It is definitely the task of economists to understand this fundamental production decision It will require a deeper understanding of the determinants of decision-making in a very poor environment than what the Homo economicus framework has left space for TOWARD A THEORY OF BEHAVIOR IN POVERTY The “poor but neoclassical” research program systematically explores the structural constraints that poverty imposes on the decision-making of an unboundedly rational individual in an environment where information is incomplete The two examples we just covered have shown that many important facts can be accounted for in this framework, but that other facts are resistant A natural tendency would then be to turn to new hypotheses, incorporating insights of psychology to better understand economic decisions This has been the research agenda of “behavioral economics” (Mullainathan and Thaler 2000) Behavioral economists have argued that three main ways in which humans deviate from the standard economic model need to be incorporated into economic reasoning Their ability to analyze information, compute, and remember is limited Their willpower is also bounded they do not always make choices that are in their best interest in the long run Finally, they are not purely self-interested Developing countries could then be seen as ideal testing grounds for some of these theories, since program evaluation experiments and field experiments can be combined, as in the example of the fertilizer program There may be more to learn about human behavior from the choices made by Kenyan farmers confronted with a real choice than from those made by American undergraduates in laboratory conditions There are a few examples of “real world” experiments that test specific hypotheses in a developed country, such as the “Save More Tomorrow” program (Thaler and Benartzi 2004), where individuals were offered the possibility of signing up for a program in which a part of their future salary increases would be saved There are also natural experiments, such as changes in default rules for enrollment in voluntary retirement savings plans (Madrian and Shea 2002), or variation in the debt structure of a financial aid package with the same monetary value (Field 2002) Real or natural experiments, however, are rare in developed countries in developing countries, it might be easier to collaborate with NGOs to offer programs with different rules, and different characteristics, designed to test specific behavioral hypotheses This could be a fruitful avenue of collaboration between practitioners"}

No problem And he reassured me that he’d been in business for quite some time and done this sort of thing for a long time But I would have to pay in cash He seemed honest enough, but I couldn’t help thinking, “Will I ever see this furniture once I return to Boston?” The cynic in me knew that there was little I could do if the seller failed to satisfy his part of the bargain Distance was not the only problem My uncle lived nearby, but could he practically take the seller to court in case of nondelivery? Perhaps, but it likely would have done little good The courts would have taken a year, or more likely many years, to review the case And perhaps the judge might accept a bribe or be a friend of a friend of the furniture seller To even the marginally honest seller, this could be a tempting situation Surely, if the furniture seller had been in Virginia, which has much better enforcement, I would have worried a lot less Now, in the end, I did buy the furniture (and actually received it) But who knows how many such transactions are hindered every day by these poorly functioning institutions? While compelling, I think this picture—that good institutions help facilitate transactions between people—is incomplete I think good institutions also help to reduce the problems that arise within a person This kind of statement is hard to make sense of with standard economic reasoning Individuals are rational, autonomous units with full self-control This frame-work doesn’t leave room for people to have problems with themselves, so what could institutions help with?

At no point did I decide this would be what is best for me (surely it isn’t) Instead, it overflowed because there was never a point at which I chose otherwise In fact, it is because I never sat down to make this decision that I ended up with a too large mailbox Part of the reason for this is procrastination and a lack of self-control Part is that other things got in the way This distinction is not just a philosophical one A growing body of research suggests that this distinction may be very important for understanding various important decisions The idea that many decisions may be passive ones draws on a large set of psychology experiments that show we often process information automatically, without it ever entering our conscious realm Perhaps the most salient (and certainly most fun) demonstration of this principle is the Stroop test Passive decision making can even affect large decisions Consider an economically important decision such as how much to save How do people make this decision? In the traditional model, people trade off consuming more today against consuming less in the future or when retired They assess their assets, their future earnings (and the riskiness of those earnings), their projected Social Security payments, and their expected life span, then use these factors to decide how much they need to put away But all this assumes that savings is a calculated, active decision Is this really the case?

After all, that’s the only difference between the two conditions In practice, however, Madrian and Shea found a large effect When the default option was not to contribute, only 38% of those given the form contributed When the default option was contribution, 86% contributed Moreover, even several years later those exposed to a contribution default still showed much higher contribution rates These results are consistent with (and motivated) the discussion above While we cannot be sure from these data what people are thinking, I would speculate that some combination of procrastination and passivity played a role Surely many looked at this form and said, “Well, I’ll decide this later ” But later never came Perhaps they were distracted by more interesting activities than deciding on 401(k) contribution rates (hard to believe, but there are more interesting activities) Perhaps it simply slipped their minds because other factors came to occupy it In either case, whatever the default on the form was, they ended up with it as their choice In fact, as time went on, they may well have justified their “decision” to themselves by saying “Five percent is what I wanted anyway,” or “That 401(k) plan wasn’t so attractive ” In this way, their passivity made their decision for them By making the small active choice to choose"}

It can provide cheaper and more efficient commitment devices than what little exists now After all, even if saving in grain provides commitment, it is an expensive way to save Vermin may eat the grain, and the interest rate earned on the grain could be zero or even negative Moreover, it is important to recognize that even if people demand such commitment devices, the free market may not do enough to provide them The highly regulated financial markets of developing countries may lead to too little innovation on these dimensions Monopoly power may also lead to inefficient provision of these commitment devices, depending on whether a monopolistic financial institution can extract more profits by catering to the desire for commitment or to the temptations themselves In this context, governments, NGOs, and donor institutions can play a large role by promoting such commitment devices Government policy can also be improved by understanding the power of temptation and the desire to avoid it This understanding could turn some conventional logic on its head For example, in designing saving policies, standard logic dictates that the more liquid an account, the more valuable it is After all, liquidity allows people to free up cash to attend to immediate needs that arise If a child gets sick, money is needed to pay for medicine This might be especially true for the poor Shocks that are small for the well-off can be big for the poor, and they would need to dip into real savings to address them Nevertheless, the poor may value illiquidity Ashraf et al (2003) give a stunning illustration They offer savers in the Philippines the opportunity to participate in lockbox savings accounts The accounts are literal lockboxes, to which the bank has the key Individuals can put aside small amounts of cash (as they want to) into the lockbox Every one to two weeks they deposit the box with the bank, which in turn deposits the contents of the lockbox into an account They also test a savings vehicle in which a certain amount of money from all of an account holder’s deposits are automatically set aside each month into a separate account Money cannot be withdrawn from this account until a predefined event occurs (such as planting season or a certain target has been reached) Both savings tools are very illiquid, yet there is a large demand for them The recognition that illiquidity can be a net good is a very important policy lesson The creation of market institutions that increase liquidity may be a net bad, not a net good Such caveats will force us, I feel, to reconsider the full set of financial market policies in developing countries Though the bulk"}

How can the cost of checking the box be enough to drive such large decisions?

The answer is very simple they survive just as they have for centuries, with the help of social ties Nonmarket institutions exist where market institutions are absent, providing an alternative supply of goods and services Community-based networks provide credit to their members when bank loans are unavailable Mutual insurance arrangements and younger relatives support the individual when times are bad or when he is too old to be productive The pervasiveness of these nonmarket institutions in developing economies, and their persistence, demand an explanation from economists And, indeed, there has been a great deal of research conducted on these institutions since the 1990s My objective in this essay is to describe what has been learned about these institutions why they emerge, why they persist, the inefficiencies that are associated with their presence, and how the presence of these institutions might affect the design of development policy This essay does not attempt to review the rich literature on nonmarket institutions that has emerged in recent years It is based instead, for"}
{"id": 547, "text": "rich literature on nonmarket institutions that has emerged in recent years It is based instead, for the most part, on my own research conducted with numerous collaborators WHY ARE NONMARKET INSTITUTIONS SO PERSISTENT? There are two basic explanations for the persistence of nonmarket institutions in developing countries The first, essentially anthropological explanation is based on the idea that the structure of economic institutions reflects the underlying culture of their participants Thus, the observation that informal credit arrangements tend to be organized commercially in the city, whereas they tend to be cooperatively organized among closely tied individuals in the village, is explained by cultural differences among the participants—individuals in the village expect to share and cooperate with each other, and the profit motive is less central in that environment By the same reasoning, nonmarket institutions continue to be prevalent in developing countries because people there are accustomed to conducting business in a particular fashion In contrast, the explanation for the prevalence of nonmarket institutions that has found favor among economists in recent years is based on the idea that markets generally tend to function imperfectly in developing countries Community ties reduce information and enforcement problems in this environment, facilitating economic activity In this view, individuals are intrinsically the same—whether they live in the city or the village, whether they live in a developing country or an advanced economy What determines the structure of institutions is the economic environment, which is determined by historical circumstances or other exogenous factors I will use this basic framework to analyze a variety of nonmarket institutions and the individual decisions that surround these institutions A TAXONOMY OF NONMARKET INSTITUTIONS The most basic role for the community in a developing economy is the provision of information, through what is known as social learning Social learning describes the process through which individuals learn from their neighbors’ decisions and experiences about a new technology or activity The idea that neighbors’ previous decisions and experiences play an important role in the diffusion of new technology and practices has been known to rural sociologists and communications specialists for decades Recent theoretical advances in economics have placed social learning within the standard economic framework, giving rise to a small but growing empirical literature that attempts to test for the presence of such learning There is little doubt that social learning and the information networks that support it play an important role in the development process, spreading new ideas and innovations But it is really geographical proximity, rather than social ties per se, that defines the boundaries of these networks The information generated by decisions and experiences is an externality in the sense that the individual receives no benefit from its provision At the same time there is no cost incurred by the provision of such information Individuals might still end up learning from members of their own social group because members of that group happen to live close to each other However, information from a stranger is, in principle, just as valuable to the individual The next level of nonmarket activity is organized through"}
{"id": 548, "text": "principle, just as valuable to the individual The next level of nonmarket activity is organized through informal institutions known as social networks Banks ration credit in developing economies because they know that by raising interest rates and allowing the market to clear, they will bring in risky borrowers By restricting business to a few trusted customers, or those who can provide collateral, they also avoid the enforcement problem in which borrowers renege on their loans Community-based networks relax these restrictions on the provision of credit by exploiting social ties Information flows smoothly within the community, and thus only responsible individuals will have access to community capital Default is also costly, since the individual can be punished by the community in the future Individuals in a tight-knit community interact along many dimensions, so, for example, a defaulter might be punished by not being invited to social gatherings, or being excluded from future business transactions Note, however, that while social networks may be very effective in generating capital, participation in these institutions is potentially costly the borrower could still default on his loan Social ties just make it less likely that such an event will occur Social ties are seen to avoid information and enforcement problems in the capital market, providing us with a simple explanation for the popularity and the persistence of credit networks in developing countries We could use the same sort of approach to explain the presence of networks in the labor market or the product market Mutual insurance arrangements and retirement assistance can also be explained in this fashion A member of a mutual insurance arrangement is less likely to default on his obligation if he is tied to the other members of his group along other (social) dimensions Similarly, younger relatives are more likely to discharge their duties to the elderly if they expect to receive the same service from the next generation when they are older, something only a stable community can provide The discussion up to this point has restricted attention to informally organized nonmarket institutions The community can also, where appropriate, establish formal nonmarket institutions with well-specified rules governing participation and behavior within the institution Well-known institutions of this sort include producers cooperatives, rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs), and credit institutions such as the Grameen Bank Essentially the same framework that we used to understand the prevalence of social networks can be used to understand the emergence of these formal non-market institutions For example, the banking system typically functions very inefficiently in developing countries The information and enforcement problems that we described earlier prevent most potential borrowers from receiving loans And the rate on deposits is kept far below the shadow price of capital by the imperfectly competitive banking system, discouraging deposits in the bank In this environment, ROSCAs, which have functioned as informal rural savings arrangements for centuries, have in some cases modified their structure to substitute for the modern banking system The simple ROSCA, found throughout the developing world, essentially consists of a small group of socially connected individuals who join together to"}

{"id": 556, "text": "Paradigm for Discrimination Theory Glenn C Loury This essay examines interconnections between “race” and economic inequality in the United States, focusing on the case of African Americans I will argue that it is crucially important to distinguish between racial discrimination and racial stigma in the study of this problem Racial discrimination has to do with how blacks are treated, while racial stigma is concerned with how black people are perceived My view is that what I call reward bias (unfair treatment of persons in formal economic transactions based on racial identity) is now a less significant barrier to the full participation by African Americans in U S society than is what I will call development bias (restricted access to resources critical for personal development but available only via informal social transactions that are difficult to regulate because they do not take place in a market context) By making these points in the specific cultural and historical context of the black experience in U S society, I hope to contribute to a deeper conceptualization of the worldwide problem of race and economic marginality EMBODIED SOCIAL SIGNIFICATION A theory of racial economic disparity should begin with some account of the phenomenon of “race” itself We need to explain why people take note of and assign significance to the skin color, hair texture, and facial bone structure of other human beings That superficial markings on human bodies are socially significant—that agents routinely partition the field of human subjects whom they encounter into groups, with this sorting convention based n the subjects’ possession of some cluster of observable bodily marks—is a universal feature of human societies My proposal is that we think about “race” as a social phenomenon resulting from the combination of two processes—categorization and signification Categorization involves the sorting of persons into a cognitively manageable number of subgroups, based on bodily marks, for the purpose of differentiating one’s dealings with such persons Signification involves the mental activity of associating certain connotations or “meanings” with these categories My argument is that, at bottom, “race” is all about “embodied social signification ” Let me dispose of a red herring at the outset Some critics (e g , Gilroy 2000) have suggested that social analysts should abandon the use of racial categories, since modern science has shown that there are no “races” as such The attempt to classify human beings on the basis of natural variation in genetic endowments across what for much of human history had been geographically isolated subpopulations is controversial (Cavalli-Sforza 2000 Olson 2002) I wish to stress, however, that my use of “race” as an instance of social cognition is an altogether distinct enterprise from using “race” as an instrument of biological taxonomy While there well may be no “races” in the biological sense, we can nevertheless adopt the linguistic convention that when saying “Person A belongs to race X,” what we mean is that “Person A possesses physical traits which (in a given society, at a fixed point in history, under the conventions of racial classification extant there and then) will cause"}

Here is a nonracial example that may help to make this point Much evidence supports the conclusion that there is disparity in social outcomes for males and females Consider two distinct venues where this is the case—the schools and the jails Compared with girls, boys are overrepresented among those doing well in math and science in the schools, while men are overrepresented among those doing poorly in society at large by ending up in jail Yet only one of these disparities is widely perceived to be a societal problem—the first Why? One possible answer is this it offends basic intuitions about the propriety of underlying social processes that boys and girls attain different levels of achievement in the technical curriculum, while no disquiet is stirred by gender disparities in the jails Because we do not easily envision a wholly legitimate causal chain of events that could produce the school disparity, we set ourselves the task of solving a problem In the face of this inequality we are inclined to interrogate our institutions—to search the record of our social practice and examine myriad possibilities in order to see where things might have gone wrong Yet nothing like this happens for male–female disparity in the jails because, tacitly if not explicitly, we are “gender essentialists ” In effect, our model of social causation posits that males and females differ—either in their biological nature or in their deep-seated acculturation—and it is this essential difference that accounts for the observed disparity As “gender essentialists,” our intuitions are not offended by the fact of vastly higher rates of imprisonment among males than among females We do not ask deeper questions about why this disparity has come about And so, since there is no problem perceived, no solution is sought Whether we are right or wrong to act as we do in these gender matters, my point is that the bare facts of disparity do not, in themselves, provide any motive for action To act, we must marry what we observe to some model of social causation This model need not be explicit it can lurk beneath the surface of our conscious reflections Still, it is the facts plus the model that lead us to perceive a given circumstance as indicative of some as yet undiagnosed failing in our social interactions, or not Now consider another example of how people’s models of the world (what they take"}
{"id": 559, "text": "or not Now consider another example of how people’s models of the world (what they take as exogenous) prevent them from seeing the social structures that may engender racial inequality Suppose taxi drivers in a big city are reluctant to stop for young black men because they fear being robbed That is, they calculate that the chance of robbery conditional on race (and, perhaps, other information, such as age and sex) exceeds a prudential threshold when the prospective fare is a young black man, but not otherwise Imagine that, as a matter of the crime statistics, this surmise is objectively correct Even so, a process of adverse selection could explain how such a racial disparity might arise If an agent knows taxis are unlikely to stop for him, and if he does not intend to rob the driver, then he may not want to rely on taxis for transportation because of the expected length of his anticipated wait It is plausible to assume that waiting costs are less for someone who intends to rob the driver than for someone who does not After all, to get in a night’s work, the robber may need only one cab to stop during the night That drivers are slow to stop for a certain group may discourage all members of that group from using taxis, but those intent on robbing will be relatively less discouraged than those who have no such intention Thus, should the drivers begin with an a priori belief that a certain group of people is more likely to harbor robbers, and so become slow to stop for them, the result may be to create incentives for selfselection within that group such that robbers become relatively more likely to hail cabs This example shows that if people on one side of a transaction are inclined to make racial generalizations when forming their beliefs, if they act on those beliefs, and if they start out believing differently about people who have different racial traits, then the actions they take can indirectly produce evidence that confirms them in their views But, being completely oblivious to such an endogenous source of racial disparity, they may mistakenly attribute the inequality to exogenous sources Thus, imagine that an observer (correctly) takes note of the fact that, on the average and all else being equal, black residential neighborhoods are more likely to decline This may lead that observer to move away from any neighborhood when more than a few blacks move into it But what if the racial composition of a neighborhood connotes decay in this manner only because, when a great number of observers act on their worst fears, the result (through some possibly complex chain of social causation) is to bring about the confirmation of their beliefs? Perhaps nonblack residents panic at the arrival of a few blacks, selling too quickly and below the market value to lower-income (black) buyers, and it is this process that promotes a neighborhood’s decline Under such circumstances observers might mistakenly attribute racially disparate behaviors to ingrained limitations of African Americans"}

Clearly, once a convention employing the self-confirming racial stereotype has been established, the observing agents’ beliefs and actions can be defended on the basis of reason But the deeper conclusion—that there is an intrinsic connection between race and crime, or race and neighborhood decline—is altogether unjustified I think it is safe to assume that this subtle distinction will elude most cab drivers, homeowners, politicians, op-ed writers, and not a few social scientists! It is this distinction between endogenous and exogenous social causation that is, I believe, the key to understanding the difference in our reformist intuitions about gender inequalities in the schools and in the jails because we think the disparity of school outcomes stems from endogenous sources, while the disparity of jail outcomes is tacitly attributed in most of our “causal models” to exogenous sources, we are not moved to the same extent to do something about the observed disparities My argument is that a given instance of social disparity is less likely to be perceived as a social problem when people take the disparity to have been caused by the deficiencies of those who lag behind My contention is that in American society, when the group in question is blacks, the risk of this kind of causal misattribution is especially great This kind of reflection on the deeper structure of our social-cognitive processes, as they bear on the issues of racial disparity, is what I had hoped to stimulate with my discussion of “biased social cognition ” And the role of “race” in such processes is what I am alluding to when I talk about “racial stigma ” I believe the disparate impact of the enforcement of antidrug laws offers a telling illustration of the value in this way of thinking There could be no drug market without sellers and buyers (Just as there would be no street prostitution without hookers and johns ) Typically, those on the selling side of such markets are more deeply involved in crime and disproportionately drawn from the bottom rungs of society When"}

Or has a bored, spoiled middle class with too much time on its hands engendered the problem in its hedonistic pursuit of a good time? How serious a given crime is seen to be by those who, through their votes, indirectly determine our policies, and how “deserved” the punishment for a given infraction, may depend on the racial identities of those involved, because the tacit causal accounts adopted by influential observers may depend on “race ” In Loury (2002) I use the theory of biased social cognition just sketched to argue that durable racial inequality can be understood as the outgrowth of a series of “vicious circles of cumulative causation” (Myrdal 1944) I have in mind a model where popular support for egalitarian policy reforms benefiting a stigmatized racial group depends on the causal explanations ordinary people are inclined to give for observed racial disparities The tacit association of “blackness” in the public’s imagination with “unworthiness” distorts cognitive processes and promotes essentialist causal misattributions In plain English, observers will have difficulty identifying with the plight of people whom they (mistakenly) see to be simply “reaping what they have sown ” In turn, this tendency to see racial disparities as communal rather than a societal problem encourages the reproduction of inequality through time because, absent some reformist interventions, the low social conditions of many blacks persist, the negative social meanings ascribed to blackness are then reinforced, and thus the racially biased social-cognitive processes are reproduced, completing the circle WHY NOT REPARATIONS? Because it has its roots in past unjust acts that were perpetrated on the basis of race, present-day racial inequality on the scale to be observed in U S society constitutes a gross historical injustice This much is clear Not so clear are the implications of this observation for present-day public policy choices In Loury (2002) I address this problem, proposing what I take to be a necessary condition for the attainment of racial justice Specifically, I claim that past racial injustice establishes a general presumption against indifference to present racial inequality Notice that this is a result-oriented, not a process-oriented criterion That is, guaranteeing the unbiased treatment of blacks from this point forward, with there being no effort taken to reduce current racial disparities, would not be sufficient to secure a racially just outcome in my view However, I do not think that the public response to this situation can or should be conceived in terms of “correcting” or “balancing” for historical violation I conclude by briefly elaborating on this point A central reality of our time is the fact that a wide racial gap has"}

{"id": 565, "text": "an experiment with better controls, and therefore has better content in informing my decisions—and, by extension, my aspirations Likewise, in forming estimates of the rate of return to education, a poor individual might look only at the experiences of similarly poor individuals, believing (perhaps correctly) that the rate of return to education calculated from other observations may be colored by contacts and connections (this issue is logically distinct from the truncation effect discussed above, in the context of Wilson’s work) Fourth, “similarity” is contextual it depends on how much mobility (or perceived mobility) there is in society The greater the extent of (perceived) mobility, the broader the aspirations window A bonded laborer may believe that there is an unbridgeable wall between him and the local shopkeeper in the village if labor is free to move and possibly change occupations, such comparisons may well be made Finally, the different dimensions of aspirations are obviously connected with different facets of the aspirations window As an economic agent who desperately seeks to escape poverty, I will emulate, imitate, and learn from the economic strategies of those in my neighborhood income or wealth group As a Hindu Indian who is drawn to the idea that Indian Muslims should head off to Pakistan, I may emulate an entirely different set of people More dangerously, an aspirations failure along one dimension may spur my ambitions along another THE ASPIRATIONS GAP AND INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOR Why are these considerations important? To address that question, we need to combine a theory of how aspirations are formed with a theory of how aspirations affect behavior I now turn to a simple—perhaps simplistic—account of this In this account, the idea of an aspirations gap plays a central role For concreteness, let me illustrate this by using material aspirations alone (the same idea can be applied, perhaps with modification, to other dimensions) The aspirations gap is simply the difference between the standard of living that’s aspired to and the standard of living that one already has I want to argue that it’s this gap—not aspirations per se, nor one’s standard of living per se—that affects future-oriented behavior The aspirations gap is a measure of how far one wants to go To complete this story, one must discuss how such a gap is filled by deliberate action The easiest way to think about it is to introduce some notion of costly investment Such investment (in education, health, or income-generating activities) raises future standards of living Presumably, this narrows the aspirations gap (an interesting variant of the argument that we don’t consider is that the aspirations themselves will slide forward as well, as newer horizons come into view) At the same time, investment is costly to the individual Current sacrifices will need to be made An economist would approach this sort of description by postulating that our individual wants to choose investment effort to maximize the difference between benefits (a reduced gap) and costs (lower current standards) 2 One implication of such an exercise is the following interesting feature individual investment efforts are minimal for both"}
{"id": 566, "text": "of such an exercise is the following interesting feature individual investment efforts are minimal for both high- and low-aspiration gaps A little reflection renders this proposition intuitively obvious Individuals whose aspirations are closely aligned to their current standards of living have little incentive to raise those standards However, individuals whose aspirations are very far from their current standards of living also have little incentive to raise standards, because the gap will remain very large before and after A lot of investment will cover only a small part of the way the overall journey is too long, and therefore not worth undertaking in the first place Thus our concept of an aspirations window, together with this description of aspirations and individual behavior, has an interesting implication If economic betterment is an important goal, the aspirations window must be opened, for otherwise there is no drive to self-betterment Yet it should not be open too wide there is the curse of frustrated aspirations There must be individuals in our immediate cognitive neighborhood who do better than we do, yet if they do a lot better, we will invest little even if such individuals remain within our cognitive neighborhood In short, the experiences of others may have little effect on us because either they lie outside our aspirations window or, even if they are within it, their living standards (which form our aspirations) are far from ours SOCIAL POLARIZATION, POVERTY, AND ASPIRATIONS FAILURE The minimal effect of an aspirations gap at both ends of the gap spectrum is crucial to the understanding of an aspirations failure How might such a failure come about for the poor? To understand this, it is necessary to think about societies in which there is a substantial amount of social polarization, or stratification The best way to do this is to think of the opposite scenario a connected society, one in which there is much (economic) diversity in every cognitive neighborhood, diversity in which every individual can justifiably think of herself as being on the attainable fringes Crudely put, a society in which there is a chain of observed, local steps between the poorest and the richest will be more vibrant, in the sense that individuals not only will have aspirations but also will have the sorts of aspirations they can act upon In contrast, a polarized society (see, e g , Esteban and Ray 1994 Wolfson 1994) is one in which there are few inhabitants between the poor and the rich 3 In such a society, there are only two possibilities First, the poor do not include the rich in their cognitive window This will especially be the case if economic polarization is aided and abetted by other forms of stratification slavery, serfdom, caste, racial discrimination Then the aspirations gap will be low, and so will individual investments for the future This sort of aspirations failure often goes by other names, most commonly fatalism But true fatalism—a deep belief that one’s destiny is preordained and beyond control—cannot be affected by socioeconomic policy This variant of fatalism—the one that says"}
{"id": 567, "text": "preordained and beyond control—cannot be affected by socioeconomic policy This variant of fatalism—the one that says there is little hope of betterment, because this is the way things have always been—can be so affected Faced with the diagnostic choice between true fatalism and an aspirations failure, one can only hope that it is the latter Second, the poor do aspire to be like the rich, but the gap is simply too large The costs of the many steps of investment are too high, and the reward—in terms of a relative narrowing of the aspirations gap—is simply too low This is another kind of aspirations failure The aspirations do exist, but the feeling is widespread that such aspirations are largely unreachable The seeming absence of class distinctions, or caste divisions, can only enhance this brand of aspirations failure, because there are no ostensible barriers to block the view of the rich from the cognitive windows of the poor Poverty in such societies will find expression not in the “fatalism” of the previous paragraph, but in frustration and envy, much like the poor admirers of Richard Corey “We thought that he was everything,/To make us wish that we were in his place” (Robinson 1922) So it is not the condition of poverty alone that is responsible for an aspirations failure It is poverty in conjunction with a lack of connectedness, the absence of a critical mass of persons who are better off than the person in question, yet not so much better off that their economic well-being is thought to be unattainable In contrast, inequality isn’t really the prime mover at all, though to some extent it may be correlated with polarization It is perfectly possible for an unequal society nevertheless to be thickly populated at all points of the economic spectrum, creating local, attainable incentives at the lower end of the wealth or income distribution Affirmative action and public education may be policy tools that help in creating this sense of local connectedness SOCIOECONOMIC CHANGE AND ASPIRATIONS So far I’ve focused on the effect of aspirations on individual behavior I now want to take this framework a step further by discussing the effect of social and economic change on aspirations (and therefore on behavior) In the next section I take up the question of deliberate activism to change the aspirations of the poor As a first example, consider the seemingly paradoxical thesis of Tocqueville ([1856] 1986) that economic development may generate social tensions and rebellions more than situations of stagnant mobility and high inequality Tocqueville was addressing the fact that an anti-feudal revolution broke out in the one European country (France) where the feudal oppression was the lightest to start with While I do not have the time here to go into the details, Toqueville’s argument is clear iniquities and oppressions that are cloaked with implacable inevitability can be borne 4 Once this sense of inevitable oppression is removed by increased mobility and increased economic development (at least in aggregate terms), the aspirations window must widen This, in turn, will increase the aspirations"}
{"id": 568, "text": "least in aggregate terms), the aspirations window must widen This, in turn, will increase the aspirations gap unless all actual standards of living can keep pace with changing aspirations The result may very well be increased conflict, rather than less Tocqueville’s thesis may thus be summarized in one of his own memorable lines “The French found their position all the more intolerable as it became better ” The very process that raises aspirations must also fulfill those aspirations in the not-toodistant future otherwise, enhanced voice can all too easily turn to violent exit 5 My second example concerns societies (such as the United States) where an increased aspirations gap may not lead to violent exit, but to increased effort In such societies, culture may be “constructed” to enhance impressions of economic mobility I do not say that there’s a deliberate conspiracy here (though who knows?) One “nondeliberate” source for this construction stems from the familiar “truncation bias” created by the media, which will report newsworthy “successes” (lottery winners, basketball superstars) but not mundane “failures ” Notice that the truncation bias grows with the underlying inequality in that society—the truncated positive half of the distribution will mistakenly suggest an even greater rate of return to occupations If such constructions raise the aspirations gap—but moderately so—that might induce hard work for a large working class with no real reward One can see how fables of economic mobility can be beneficial for worker productivity 6 Furthermore, while the notion of illusory mobility cannot be immediately extended to developing countries, there are parallels For instance, to what extent might relatively costless lip service, accolades, and awards for participatory collective activity by the poor directly (albeit unwittingly) serve to postpone real economic change in their living conditions? For instance, Appadurai (2002) writes, referring to a (justly celebrated) alliance of three urban NGOs in Mumbai, India In June 2001, at a major meeting at the United Nations,  the Alliance and its partners elsewhere in the world, built a model house as well as a model children’s toilet in the lobby of the main United Nations Building, after considerable internal debate within the SDI and official resistance at the UN These models were visited by Kofi Annan in a festive atmosphere which left an indelible impression of material empowerment on the world of UN bureaucrats and NGO officials present Annan was surrounded by poor women from India and South Africa, singing and dancing, as he walked through the model house and the model toilet, in the heart of his own bureaucratic empire It was a magical moment, full of possibilities for the Alliance, and for the Secretary-General, as they engaged jointly and together with the global politics of poverty I cannot help but be caught up in Appadurai’s obvious enthusiasm, yet I wonder whether such “festive” activities might have the effect of staving off—rather than fostering—deep change Finally, one can use this sort of framework to ask whether the poor can be “hijacked” to serve other “cultures,” such as the rise of religious fundamentalism In the Gujarat genocide"}
{"id": 569, "text": "“hijacked” to serve other “cultures,” such as the rise of religious fundamentalism In the Gujarat genocide of 2002, the lives and livelihoods of several thousand Muslims were destroyed by rampaging Hindu mobs Fundamentalism aside, two things appear evident first (as in all the great communal riots), there was a strong economic component to the violence businesses and commercial establishments were targets Second, the poor—often not excluding tribals and Dalits who occupy the bottom of the Hindu hierarchy—joined forces with upper-class Hindus to loot and kill There is no doubt that money exchanged hands to facilitate such alliances, but in the words of Engineer, “This does not explain the fury with which they attacked The constant propaganda against Muslims—they are enemies and anti-nationals who must be taught a lesson—also had its effect The Vishwa Hindu Parishad, in order to fight Muslims with the help of Dalits, expressed solidarity with them as Hindus and instilled in them a strong dose of Hinduness while deemphasising their Dalitness” (Engineer 2002) And, I might add, their poverty The Gujarat carnage is only one example of how a failed capacity to aspire in the (direct) material sense may actually ignite other (relatively indirect) aspirational routes The former failure, in turn, may arise from an economically polarized society 7 In the Indian case, there is an odd twist to the question of religious fundamentalism I have emphasized the “push” into a distinct aspirational dimension (religion) emanating from the failure along another aspirational dimension (economic well-being) In addition, there may be “pulls ” The demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992 may have raised fundamentalist aspirations and the level of violence in its own right, in an eerie echo of Tocqueville’s reading of the French Revolution COLLECTIVE ACTION AND ASPIRATIONS Now let me turn to the effects that may be deliberately generated through collective action What are the avenues of deliberate, significant influence on the capacity to aspire? I want to mention three pathways, each of which can have significant impact on aspirations and the consequent future orientation of individuals 8 Groups as Internal Conveyors of Information Groups are repositories of pooled information, which they can credibly convey to every member For instance, the simple fact that group members are saving (or are making a commitment to save) is information that can be conveyed—with good effect —to all members The key word in this context is pooling the sharing of the experience of peers Suppose that you believe the rate of return to primary education is high, and want to convey this to a poor individual in order to get him to send his son to school There is a simple reason why this statement will mean very little to him (see also my remarks on activism in a slightly different context) there is no experience quite as compelling as the experience of your immediate family and, more broadly, those in your socioeconomic and spatial neighborhood You might say that econometricians had found a high rate of private return to investment in primary schooling in a study of nationwide panel"}

I introduce here the notion of an aspirations gap the distance between what an individual might aspire to and the conditions she currently finds herself in The main observation here is that both a large aspirations gap and a small aspirations gap may be inimical to investment effort to better one’s own conditions The latter occurs because there is very little to aspire toward the former, because there is too much Both conditions may be present in a society that is polarized, either economically or socially, but the failure to invest may manifest itself in different forms in each case the former in fatalism, the latter in frustration Second, how do socioeconomic conditions influence the aspirations window and, therefore, aspirations? There are several pathways discussed in the essay in particular, I address the seemingly paradoxical thesis of Tocqueville that economic development may generate social tensions and rebellions more than stagnant mobility and high inequality do I study this as an example of how rapid development and increased mobility may widen the aspirations window, raising the possibility that (even positive) economic change may be associated with the potential for increased conflict I also discuss cultures that may be constructed to enhance impressions of economic mobility In such situations, an increased aspirations gap may not lead to violent exit, but to increased effort I also entertain the possibility that a failure of aspirations along one dimension (such as economic well-being) may propel a move into"}
{"id": 572, "text": "a failure of aspirations along one dimension (such as economic well-being) may propel a move into a distinct aspirational dimension (such as religious fundamentalism) The aspirations-based view in this essay should not detract from the possibility (an important possibility, in my opinion) that a poverty trap is very difficult to reverse, no matter how strong the drive and effort of the trapped individual It is to suggest, however, that additional reinforcement mechanisms may be at work In particular, as discussed, a circle of low (or frustrated) aspirations and endemic poverty may be a self-sustaining outcome Finally, while I have focused on poverty throughout this essay, the idea of socially determined aspirations (and its two-way interaction with individual behavior) may be relevant in other contexts as well At the risk of appearing somewhat cryptic, one might use these ideas to explore a variety of socioeconomic issues why relatively affluent countries destroyed by war may grow back quickly, why middle-income countries often grow faster than either their rich or their poor counterparts, why immigrants may save at extraordinarily high rates, or why polarized societies may exhibit low social mobility But these will be the subjects of other essays NOTES 1 See, for example, Karandikar et al (1998) Borgers and Sarin (2001) Bendor et al (2001a, 2001b) Dixon (2000) Gilboa and Schmeidler (2001) and Ray (1998) More generally, the fact that individuals may use the consumption experiences of others as a basis for what they themselves might want is, of course, not a new idea in economics, though by and large it has remained outside the mainstream The early work of Veblen (1947) and Duesenberry (1949) comes immediately to mind But I have in mind something a bit different from conspicuous consumption, envy, or keeping up with the Joneses, issues that Veblen emphasized Rather than envy, individuals may use the experiences of others (and perhaps their own past experiences) as the yardstick for setting goals for themselves, against which they evaluate the pleasures and pains of their own immediate experience This is logically distinct from envy 2 Here is a slightly more formal account If s denotes an individual’s current standard of living, and a the standard that’s aspired to, then the aspirations gap is Thus someone with extraordinarily high aspirations relative to his current standard will be “fully gapped,” as it were, having an aspirations gap of 1 Someone who does not look beyond his current lot will have a s, and the aspirations gap will be zero Investment i raises future standards of living (say, according to some function σ(i, s), thus narrowing the aspirations gap, but is costly to the individual Denote this cost function by c(i) An agent may be viewed as choosing i to minimize the sum (perhaps weighted) of gap and cost g (a, s’) + c (i), subject to the constraint that s' = σ(i, s) 3 Note that connectedness is a statement about observables It is far from clear that connectedness in individual wealth, assets, or income translates directly into connectedness in observed standards of living An"}
{"id": 573, "text": "in individual wealth, assets, or income translates directly into connectedness in observed standards of living An example of a situation in which the two notions of connectedness are firmly linked is one in which no good is consumed for the purpose of social signaling Then a standard set of conditions yields the continuity of consumption (or expenditure) in income, and endowment connectedness immediately translates into consumption connectedness This equivalence fails, however, if there are “goods” (such as wedding banquets) that are “consumed” simply to convey status Following Bernheim (1994) and others, it can be then shown that such expenditure on such items is necessarily clumped in discrete categories, even if the underlying distribution of endowments is smoothly dispersed Such clumping helps to destroy connectedness, and can precipitate an aspirations failure 4 Compare with Appadurai’s argument that the poor display “fairly deep moral attachment to norms and beliefs that directly support their own degradation ” 5 A lesser-known idea of Albert Hirschman is the “tunnel” effect (see Hirschman and Rothschild 1973) You are caught in a multilane tunnel and all traffic is jammed as far up as you can see Suddenly the lane next to you starts to move You’re still stuck How would you feel?

The standard econometric answer is to consider plausibly exogenous variation in malaria A possible source of such variation comes from targeted interventions in public health The present study considers two major attempts to eradicate malaria in the Americas during the twentieth century The first episode analyzed took place in the southern United States, largely in the 1920s In the decades before, the cause and transmission mechanism of the disease were first understood by European physicians, and this knowledge allowed the US Army to attempt scientifically based campaigns against malaria in areas it had recently occupied (Havana and the Panama Canal Zone) Subsequently, this wealth of new knowledge and experience related to disease was applied to the malaria problem in the south The second episode is the worldwide malaria eradication campaign, and, in particular, as it was implemented in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico (starting in the 1950s) The efforts to eradicate malaria worldwide were spurred on by the discovery of DDT, a powerful pesticide After World War II, the World Health Organization (WHO) helped many afflicted countries put together programs of spraying to combat malaria transmission The campaigns in these regions partially interrupted the malaria transmission cycle and brought about marked drops in infection in a relatively short period of time (Further background on the disease and the eradication efforts is found in Section I ) Sufficient time has passed that we can evaluate the long-term consequences of these eradication campaigns The relatively rapid impact of the treatment campaigns combine with cross-area heterogeneity to form the research design of the present study These four countries (the United States, Brazil, Columbia, and Mexico) are geographically variegated, such that, within each country, some regions have climates that support malaria transmissions, while other regions do not Areas with high malaria infection rates had more to gain from eradication, but the non-malarious areas serve as a comparison group, filtering out common trends in national policy, for example The reductions in disease burden occur in the space of a few years, allowing me to identifying likely childhood exposure with sufficient precision Moreover, these episodes of rapid progress against malaria were made possible by critical innovations to knowledge and spending, which are shocks that came from outside the studied areas This latter fact mitigates the usual concern about policy endogeneity and reverse causality The particular goal of the present study is to identify the effect that childhood exposure to malaria eradication has on subsequent labor productivity as an adult While direct effects of malaria on adults can be partially measured with"}

Louis Molineaux (1988) reports on the WHO typology of malaria intensity (and associated malaria-infection rates among children) non-endemic (0 percent), hypoendemic (0–10 percent), mesoendemic (10–50 percent), hyperendemic (50–75 percent), and holoendemic (75–100 percent) Molineaux also reports estimates of the spatial distribution of different endemic zones throughout the world (Both the typology and its associated geography are derived from the experience of many experts and do not simply reflect the opinion of that one author, however ) Taking the midpoint of the reported intervals, information about the types of endemicity within each country is used to estimate the cross-area differences in malaria burden prior to the campaigns The pre-eradication malaria burden in the United States ranged from malaria-free to mesoendemic, representing a within-country difference in malaria-infection rates of approximately 0 3 Areas within each of the three Latin American countries varied from essentially zero to hyperendemic, for a range of"}

Consider the episode from the United States People born in 1820 never worked in the same labor market with cohorts exposed to the anti-malaria campaign as children Similarly, people born in 1960 always worked alongside those fully exposed to the treatment As seen in the Figure 4, the end points tend to be a bit closer together, but a gap remains Similar patterns are seen for the Latin American countries, although the span of years covered in those samples is too short to completely separate these own-cohort versus spillover effects There is therefore little indication of large, negative spillover effects from the entrance of these cohorts to the labor market This contrasts with the interpretation of health effects offered in the Acemoglu and Johnson (2006) study Again, it bears noting that their study analyzed large changes 32 American Economic Journal applied economics\b April 2010 in mortality, which in a sense tilt their exercise toward finding Malthusian effects, relative to analyzing a disease with low case fatality, such as the malaria present in the Americas Bleakley (2007b) looks for across-cohort spillover effects for malaria and hookworm eradications in the southern United States and finds them to be positive, although considerably smaller than the main effect of childhood exposure to eradication That same study also examines the effect of hookworm and malaria eradication on aggregate income via the childhood-exposure mechanism and finds estimates that are, if anything, a bit higher than those based on cohort comparisons such as the present study C Comparison to Other Cohort-Based Studies of Eradication Two other recent studies (Lucas 2009, and Cutler et al 2009) analyze the path of outcomes across cohorts by their effective exposure to eradication campaigns Their methodologies are broadly similar to the ones I employ here, and so I now compare and contrast their results with those above An advantage of these two papers over the present study is that they have access to measurements of rates of spleen inflammation across areas, which are probably better proxies of the rate of malaria infection than the endemicity variable used in Section VA However, the disadvantages of these studies relative to this one are two-fold First, they assign pre-campaign malaria to individuals based on their place of residence rather than their place of birth Thus, selective migration could be a confound 16 Second, the two other studies analyze"}

Some political economy arguments We have argued that the problems of omitted variable bias which randomized evaluations are designed to address are real and that randomized evaluations are feasible They are no more costly than other types of surveys, and are far cheaper than pursuing ineffective policies So why are they so rare? Cook (2001) attributes their rarity in education to the post-modern culture in American education schools, which is hostile to the traditional conception of causation that underlies statistical implementation Pritchett (forthcoming) argues that program advocates systematically mislead swing voters into believing exaggerated estimates of program impacts Advocates block randomized evaluations since they would reveal programs’ true impacts to voters Duflo and Kremer 29 A complementary explanation is that policy makers are not systematically fooled, but rather have difficulty gauging the quality of evidence in part because advocates can suppress unfavorable evaluation results Suppose retrospective regressions yield estimated program effects equal to the true effect plus measurement error plus a bias term, possibly with mean zero Program advocates then select the highest estimates to present to policy makers, while any opponents select the most negative estimates Knowing this, policy makers rationally discount these estimates for example, if advocates present a study showing 100% rate of return, the policy maker might assume the true return is 10% In this environment there is little incentive to conduct randomized evaluations Since the resulting estimates include no bias term, they are unlikely to be high enough or low enough that advocates will present them to policy makers Even if results are presented to policy makers, those policy makers unable to gauge the quality of particular studies will discount them Why fund a project that a randomized evaluation suggests has a 25% rate of return when advocates of competing projects claim a 100% rate of return? 4 3 Evaluation in international organizations The discussion in the preceding sections naturally suggests what international organizations could do to support the use of credible evaluation methods, including randomized evaluations This section discusses several roles the international agencies can play in promoting and financing rigorous evaluations It is almost certainly counter-productive to demand that all projects be subject to impact evaluations Clearly, all projects need to be monitored to make sure that they actually happen and to avoid misuse of funds However, some programs, such as central bank independence, simply cannot be evaluated with the methods discussed in this paper Even among projects that could potentially be evaluated, not all projects need impact evaluations In fact, the value of a poorly identified impact evaluation is very low and its cost, in terms of credibility, is high, especially if international organizations take a leading role in promoting quality evaluation A first objective is thus to cut down on the number of wasteful evaluations Any proposed impact evaluation should be reviewed by a committee before any money is spent"}

ROBERT E HALL AND CHARLES I JONES Output per worker varies enormously across countries Why? On an account ing basis our analysis shows that differences in physical capital and educational attainment can only partially explain the variation in output per worker-we find a large amount of variation in the level of the Solow residual across countries At a deeper level, we document that the differences in capital accumulation, productiv ity, and therefore output per worker are driven by differences in institutions and government policies, which we call social infrastructure We treat social infrastruc ture as endogenous, determined historically by location and other factors captured in part by language I INTRODUCTION In 1988 output per worker in the United States was more than 35 times higher than output per worker in Niger In just over ten days the average worker in the United States produced as much as an average worker in Niger produced in an entire year Explaining such vast differences in economic performance is one of the fundamental challenges of economics Analysis based on an aggregate production function provides some insight into these differences, an approach taken by Mankiw, Romer, and Weil [1992] and Dougherty and Jorgenson [1996], among others Differences among countries can be attributed to differences in human capital, physical capital, and productivity Building on their analysis, our results suggest that differences in each element of the production function are important In particu lar, however, our results emphasize the key role played by productivity For example, consider the 35-fold difference in output per worker between the United States and Niger Different capital intensities in the two countries contributed a factor of 1 5 to the income differences, while different levels of educational attainment contributed a factor of 3 1 The remaining differ ence- a factor of 7 7 -remains as the productivity residual  A previous version of this paper was circulated under the title \"The Productivity of Nations \" This research was supported by the Center for"}

And why are some countries so much more productive than others? These are the questions that this paper tackles When aggregated through the production function, the answers to these questions add up to explain the differences in output per worker across countries Our hypothesis is that differences in capital accumulation, productivity, and therefore output per worker are fundamentally related to differences in social infrastructure across countries By social infrastructure we mean the institutions and government policies that determine the economic environment within which individuals accumulate skills, and firms accumulate capital and produce output A social infrastructure favorable to high levels of output per worker provides an environment that supports produc tive activities and encourages capital accumulation, skill acquisi tion, invention, and technology transfer Such a social infrastruc ture gets the prices right so that, in the language of North and Thomas [1973], individuals capture the social returns to their actions as private returns Social institutions to protect the output of individual produc tive units from diversion are an essential component of a social infrastructure favorable to high levels of output per worker Thievery, squatting, and Mafia protection are examples of diver sion undertaken by private agents Paradoxically, while the government is potentially the most efficient provider of social infrastructure that protects against diversion, it is also in practice a primary agent of diversion throughout the world Expropriation, confiscatory taxation, and corruption are examples of public diversion Regulations and laws may protect against diversion, but they all too often constitute the chief vehicle of diversion in an economy Across 127 countries we find a powerful and close association between output per worker and measures of social infrastructure Countries with long-standing policies favorable to productive activities-rather than diversion-produce much more output per worker For example, our analysis suggests that the observed difference in social infrastructure between Niger and the United This content downloaded from 171 64 220 35 on Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17 21 30 UTC All use subject"}

The central hypothesis of this paper is that the primary, fundamental determinant of a country's long-run economic performance is its social infrastructure By social infrastructure we mean the institutions and government policies that provide the incentives for individuals and firms in an economy Those incentives can encourage productive activities such as the accumulation of skills or the development of new goods and production techniques, or those incentives can encour age predatory behavior such as rent-seeking, corruption, and theft Productive activities are vulnerable to predation If a farm cannot be protected from theft, then thievery will be an attractive alternative to farming A fraction of the labor force will be employed as thieves, making no contribution to output Farmers will spend more of their time protecting their farms from thieves and consequently grow fewer crops per hour of effort Social control of diversion has two benefits First, in a society free of diversion, productive units are rewarded by the full amount of their production where there is diversion, on the other hand, it acts like a tax on output Second, where social control of diversion is effective, individual units do not need to invest resources in avoiding diversion In many cases, social control is much cheaper than private avoidance Where there is no effective social control of burglary, for example, property owners must hire guards and put up fences Social control of burglary involves two elements"}

We see in Figure II that measured social infrastructure varies considerably along this open, GADP, the fraction of population speaking English at home, the fraction of population speaking a European language at home, and a quadratic polynomial for distance from the equator In addition, total educational attainment and the mining share of GDP were included in Vbut not in W i e , they were not treated as independent This content downloaded from 171 64 220 35 on Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17 21 30 UTC All use subject to http //about jstor org/terms 104 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS TABLE II BASIC RESULTS FOR OUTPUT PER WORKER log YIL = oa + A3S + E OverID test Coeff test Social p-value"}

ROBERT E HALL AND CHARLES I JONES Output per worker varies enormously across countries Why? On an account ing basis our analysis shows that differences in physical capital and educational attainment can only partially explain the variation in output per worker-we find a large amount of variation in the level of the Solow residual across countries At a deeper level, we document that the differences in capital accumulation, productiv ity, and therefore output per worker are driven by differences in institutions and government policies, which we call social infrastructure We treat social infrastruc ture as endogenous, determined historically by location and other factors captured in part by language I INTRODUCTION In 1988 output per worker in the United States was more than 35 times higher than output per worker in Niger In just over ten days the average worker in the United States produced as much as an average worker in Niger produced in an entire year Explaining such vast differences in economic performance is one of the fundamental challenges of economics Analysis based on an aggregate production function provides some insight into these differences, an approach taken by Mankiw, Romer, and Weil [1992] and Dougherty and Jorgenson [1996], among others Differences among countries can be attributed to differences in human capital, physical capital, and productivity Building on their analysis, our results suggest that differences in each element of the production function are important In particu lar, however, our results emphasize the key role played by productivity For example, consider the 35-fold difference in output per worker between the United States and Niger Different capital intensities in the two countries contributed a factor of 1 5 to the income differences, while different levels of educational attainment contributed a factor of 3 1 The remaining differ ence- a factor of 7 7 -remains as the productivity residual  A previous version of this paper was circulated under the title \"The Productivity of Nations \" This research was supported by the Center for"}

And why are some countries so much more productive than others? These are the questions that this paper tackles When aggregated through the production function, the answers to these questions add up to explain the differences in output per worker across countries Our hypothesis is that differences in capital accumulation, productivity, and therefore output per worker are fundamentally related to differences in social infrastructure across countries By social infrastructure we mean the institutions and government policies that determine the economic environment within which individuals accumulate skills, and firms accumulate capital and produce output A social infrastructure favorable to high levels of output per worker provides an environment that supports produc tive activities and encourages capital accumulation, skill acquisi tion, invention, and technology transfer Such a social infrastruc ture gets the prices right so that, in the language of North and Thomas [1973], individuals capture the social returns to their actions as private returns Social institutions to protect the output of individual produc tive units from diversion are an essential component of a social infrastructure favorable to high levels of output per worker Thievery, squatting, and Mafia protection are examples of diver sion undertaken by private agents Paradoxically, while the government is potentially the most efficient provider of social infrastructure that protects against diversion, it is also in practice a primary agent of diversion throughout the world Expropriation, confiscatory taxation, and corruption are examples of public diversion Regulations and laws may protect against diversion, but they all too often constitute the chief vehicle of diversion in an economy Across 127 countries we find a powerful and close association between output per worker and measures of social infrastructure Countries with long-standing policies favorable to productive activities-rather than diversion-produce much more output per worker For example, our analysis suggests that the observed difference in social infrastructure between Niger and the United This content downloaded from 171 64 220 35 on Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17 21 30 UTC All use subject"}

First, from an accounting standpoint, differences in physical capital intensity and differ ences in educational attainment explain only a small fraction of the differences in output per worker across countries One interpre tation of this result is that we must turn to other differences, such as the quality of human capital, on-the-job training, or vintage effects That is, we could add to the inputs included in the production function A"}

The central hypothesis of this paper is that the primary, fundamental determinant of a country's long-run economic performance is its social infrastructure By social infrastructure we mean the institutions and government policies that provide the incentives for individuals and firms in an economy Those incentives can encourage productive activities such as the accumulation of skills or the development of new goods and production techniques, or those incentives can encour age predatory behavior such as rent-seeking, corruption, and theft Productive activities are vulnerable to predation If a farm cannot be protected from theft, then thievery will be an attractive alternative to farming A fraction of the labor force will be employed as thieves, making no contribution to output Farmers will spend more of their time protecting their farms from thieves and consequently grow fewer crops per hour of effort Social control of diversion has two benefits First, in a society free of diversion, productive units are rewarded by the full amount of their production where there is diversion, on the other hand, it acts like a tax on output Second, where social control of diversion is effective, individual units do not need to invest resources in avoiding diversion In many cases, social control is much cheaper than private avoidance Where there is no effective social control of burglary, for example, property owners must hire guards and put up fences Social control of burglary involves two elements First is the teaching that stealing"}

In a developed country, where the government observes income for most people and can redistribute through the tax system, this framework is broadly Figure 1 Example of Progressive Post-Tax Income Schedules With and Without a Universal Basic Income (UBI) UBI Post-tax income, α(y) α(y) with no UBI α(y) with UBI Pre-tax income, (y) 45° line Universal Basic Incomes vs Targeted Transfers in Developing Countries  205 applicable However, if we are interested in the poor in developing countries, it is more complicated In less-developed countries, substantial activity occurs in the “informal sector” that includes casual labor, undocumented firms, and small farms Thus, most individuals are outside the tax net Jensen (2016) documents that the share of employment for which people pay any income taxes (and therefore for which the government observes income) rises substantially with real per-capita national GDP Conversely, in most poor countries, the government does not observe any information about income for most people, and in particular, for the poor In Indonesia and Peru— the two countries that we explore in detail below—Jensen reports that 87 5 percent and 79 percent of the countries’ employed populations, respectively, have incomes below the tax exclusion thresholds Jensen argues that these thresholds emerge from the work environment—when most people work in large firms, the government can easily observe incomes (Kleven, Kreiner, and Saez 2016) But when there is a large informal sector, or many people work on their own or in tiny firms, as is true in most developing countries (Hsieh and Olken 2014), this is not possible Why does this matter? Figure 2 illustrates an example tax schedule with and without a universal basic income when most individuals—in developing countries, often upwards of 80 percent of people—fall into a tax-exempt region In the taxexempt region, everyone receives the same net transfer regardless of whether they are in the 5th or 70th percentile of income However, to finance a universal basic income of a size similar to the case in Figure 1, one would need to increase marginal tax rates substantially more for those relatively few people inside the tax net To the Figure 2 Example of Post-Tax Income Schedules With and Without a Universal Basic Income (UBI), with a Tax-Exempt Region Tax-exempt region UBI Post-tax income, α(y) Pre-tax income, (y) α(y) with no UBI α(y) with UBI 206  Journal of Economic Perspectives extent that these individuals are particularly productive, or that, for a corporate income tax, the firms paying it are more productive, such a tax increase may have disproportionally larger efficiency consequences In this way, a universal basic income will function somewhat differently in a country with a large number of people outside the"}
{"id": 791, "text": "income will function somewhat differently in a country with a large number of people outside the tax net In particular, 1) the net transfer could be the same for the majority of the population (all those below the tax-exempt cutoff), which may not be the optimal resource allocation if we want to focus on the poorest of the poor and 2) relatively few households will be able to contribute to the financing, which may restrict the overall level of funds available for the universal basic income In countries with large numbers of people outside the tax net, any attempt to target resources toward the poorest of the poor requires using an alternative data collection approach beyond the income tax system The discussion thus far has assumed that a universal basic income is financed entirely through income taxes (individual or corporate), which in developing countries are paid primarily by the very top earners These taxes combined with import duties (which are also likely to fall on the rich), make up about 42 percent of tax revenue for low- and middle-income countries (according to the most recent World Bank World Development Indicators), with the rest of tax revenue in these countries coming from consumption taxes, which are typically proportional to consumption A universal basic income financed through a combination of an income and consumption tax will look closer to a combination of Figures 1 and 2 In this case, one can tax back some of the transfer on households below the income tax exemption through the consumption tax, but the fact that the tax is generally proportional to consumption limits the flexibility in doing so How to Target the Poor in Developing Countries How can developing country governments target the poor when income is not observable? When the government observes a proxy for income and targets households based on that, one has what is termed a “proxy-means test ” The implementation of a proxy-means test is typically based on large, periodic quasi-censuses of the population, focusing on those most likely to be poor In these censuses, government enumerators go door-to-door, often visiting millions of households Some countries, such as India, do target government assistance based on self-reported and unverified income, but this is the exception, not the rule, because people can easily lie if there is no way of verifying it Instead, government census enumerators typically ask about assets, all of which are easy to observe directly Examples might include ownership of items such as televisions and refrigerators, the type of material used in one’s roof, floor, and walls, the number of rooms in one’s house, and so on The government uses these assets to predict incomes (or per-capita consumption, which can be easier to measure in survey data) Thus, eligibility for benefits is based on predicted, rather than actual, income This method is quite common, and is used in both large countries such as Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Mexico, and the Philippines, as well as a number of smaller countries, ranging from Burkina Faso to Ecuador to Jamaica (Fiszbein and Schady 2009) Rema Hanna"}

In addition, one might fear that such a system is prone to elite capture for example, a powerful headman might manipulate the meeting to put his nephew on the list of beneficiaries However, when we and our coauthors tried such an approach experimentally in Indonesia and compared it experimentally, we found that citizens vastly preferred the ­community based-approach to a data-based proxy-means test In addition, the com- munity approach did a much better job of identifying those households who selfassessed themselves to be poor, and was only slightly worse at identifying the poor based on per-capita consumption levels Furthermore, there was no detectable elite capture (Alatas, Banerjee, Hanna, Olken, and Tobias 2012) A community targeting approach avoids some key pitfalls of the proxy-means test related to transparency and horizontal equity The process for allocating beneficiaries under the community approach was completely public and ­transparent—unlike the proxy-means test that relies on secret formulas to produce a list of eligible and ineligible households that villagers do not really understand It also addresses the perception of a horizontal equity problem—from the perspective of the villagers, if it is broadly agreed that person A is poorer than person B, they can ensure that person A receives the transfer Universal Basic Incomes vs Targeted Transfers in Developing Countries  221 Community targeting also has the potential to be less distortionary In Alatas et al (2012), we showed that communities appear to target based on earning potential, rather than actual earnings For example, widows—who have lower earning potential than households headed by men—appear to be more likely to be ranked as poor, even conditional on their actual income level The same is true for education those with high education, and hence high earning power, are ranked as wealthier than their actual income alone would imply To the extent that communities target based on earning potential rather than actual income, such a system has the potential to be less distortionary not only than a proxy-means test, but also than a regular income tax Community targeting has important limitations—in particular, it does not readily allow for comparisons across locations, and if implemented at scale, could lead households to take actions to hide their income from their neighbors But its potential advantages may mean that it is worth wider consideration"}

To explore this question, I use data from shipping records and historical documents reporting slave ethnicities to construct estimates of the number of slaves exported from each country during Africa’s slave trades I ﬁnd a robust negative relationship between the number of slaves exported from a country and current economic performance To better understand if the relationship is causal, I examine the historical evidence on selection into the slave trades and use instrumental variables Together the evidence suggests that the slave trades had an adverse effect on economic development I INTRODUCTION Africa’s economic performance in the second half of the twentieth century has been poor One, often informal, explanation for Africa’s underdevelopment is its history of extraction, characterized by two events the slave trades and colonialism Bairoch (1993, p 8) writes that “there is no doubt that a large number of negative structural features of the process of economic underdevelopment have historical roots going back to European colonization ” Manning (1990, p 124) echoes Bairoch but focuses on the slave trades, writing, “Slavery was corruption it involved theft, bribery, and exercise of brute force as well as ruses Slavery thus may be seen as one source of precolonial origins for modern corruption ” Recent empirical studies suggest that Africa’s history can explain part of its current underdevelopment These studies focus on the link between countries’ colonial experience and current economic development (Grier 1999 Englebert 2000a, 2000b A previous version of this paper was circulated under the title “Slavery, Institutional Development, and Long-Run Growth in Africa ” I am grateful to the editor, Edward Glaeser, and three anonymous referees for comments that substantially improved this paper I also thank Daron Acemoglu, Robert Bates, Albert Berry, Loren Brandt, Jon Cohen, Bill Easterly, Stanley Engerman, Azim Essaji, Joseph Inikori, Martin Klein, Pat Manning, Ted Miguel, Jim Robinson, Aloysius Siow, Ken Sokoloff, Dan Treﬂer, Chris Udry, Jeffrey Williamson, and seminar participants at the University of British Columbia, the University of California Los Angeles, the University of California San Diego, Harvard University, the University of Michigan, New York University, Pennsylvania State University, the University of Rochester, the University of Southern California, the University of Toronto, York University, the CIFAR, the SED Conference, the CEA Meetings, the SSHA Meetings, the ITAM Summer Camp in Macroeconomics, the IEHC, the NBER, and the WGAPE meetings for valuable comments and suggestions I thank Maira Avila and Ken Jackson for excellent research assistance C⃝2008 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology The Quarterly Journal of Economics, February 2008 139 Downloaded from https //academic oup com/qje/article/123/1/139/1889789 by Boston College user on 30 June 2025 140 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2001, 2002 Bertocchi and Canova 2002 Lange 2004) However, the other important event in Africa’s history, its slave trades, has yet to be examined empirically There are reasons to expect that the slave trades may have been at least as important as"}

A key part of the task at hand is to ensure that aid policies strengthen domestic institutions rather than undermine them Especially in low-income countries, aid agencies often bypass messy, corrupt states and instead channel funds through a cadre of nongovernment organizations, contractors, and other nonstate actors There are reasons for this Doing so may be necessary on occasion, as, for instance, when delivering humanitarian aid after a natural disaster Also, donor-country politicians may find it hard to justify working with governments seen as corrupt or compromised But in the long term, aid transfers that bypass the state may fail to improve—and in some cases may even harm—the state’s capacity to provide invisible infrastructure to its citizens Even in the short term, cutting out the domestic state inhibits the use of two vital tools local information about what works in context, and mechanisms for taking citizen preferences into account The loss of these tools can damage long-term prospects for poverty reduction, because people who feel they have no voice in development may be less willing to support it by paying taxes We argue, therefore, that a sustainable end to global poverty will require that the international development community and civil society organizations invest resources in interventions that can help build capable, democratic state institutions Some guidance on successful interventions comes from recent empirical contributions in the political economy of development literature, which support an agency perspective on government functioning governments comprise individuals interacting along a human chain of command Governance failures like corruption and leakage of funds reflect failures to resolve misaligned incentives and informational asymmetries along this human chain (for an overview, see Finan, Olken, and Pande 2017) Designing such reforms requires insights from the fields of political economy and mechanism design, as well as a theory of government that allows the disempowered to act as principal Ultimately, it is democracy, done right, that best allows citizens to demand what they need to end poverty Can We Rely on Growth to End Poverty? Economic growth has significantly lowered global poverty (Kraay 2006 Dollar, Kleineberg, and Kraay 2016) China alone was home to three-quarters of the 1 12 billion people lifted out of extreme poverty worldwide between 1981 and 2013, when it grew at an average rate of 10 percent per year India grew at an average annual rate of 6 2 percent over the same period, and it had about 190 million fewer people in extreme poverty in 2013 than in 1981 Indonesia, which saw average growth of 5 percent, had 92 million fewer 2 2 Authors’ calculations using poverty data from PovcalNet (2018) and data on GDP growth from World Development Indicators (2018b) 178  Journal of Economic Perspectives One would hope for growth to"}

Consider people living in a remote rural village separated from the nearest city by a river, a forest, and steep mountains (Castañeda et al 2018) What would it take for them to gain enough income to exit poverty? A traditional model of economic development that focuses on raising earnings might call for investments in physical infrastructure—perhaps the construction of a road to allow them to sell goods or make their way to the city for work How would this road get built? A bridge across the river isn’t enough, nor is a tunnel under the mountain, nor is a way through the forest Rather, all of these things need to be constructed and linked into a viable path from the village to the city Private companies might build some of these elements—but the road as a whole is expensive and difficult enough that the state will need to coordinate and, likely, subsidize parts of construction Rural roads, by themselves, may not bring jobs to the village (Asher and Novosad 2018) But for many male villagers, the road might still enable an escape from poverty They can get on the bus, go to the town, and find manual work there, 3 Authors’ calculations"}

Furthermore, if we expand our perspective beyond the one woman to all of the world’s extreme poor, then cash transfers likely become too expensive to be a sustainable answer for singlehandedly ending global poverty 5 (Relatedly, Hanna and Olken in this symposium discuss the tax implications of implementing a universal basic income program versus a cheaper targeted transfer program ) Thus, a woman’s road out of poverty is different from a man’s, but similarly includes many components She needs a way to save money and smooth consumption, receive remittances, hide money from friends and family when she needs to, and provide them with informal insurance when she can Even if she is provided a bank account, if she isn’t trained in its use she may well cash out any transfers, keep the account at zero balance, and leave the benefits of that account unrealized (Field, Pande, Rigol, Schaner, and Moore 2016) She needs to have quality education for her children so they can earn more than she does, escape poverty themselves, and 4 Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez (2014, 2018) find similar mid-term evidence from Uganda’s Youth Opportunity Program, but that in the longer run (nine years) the"}

A first step is to model the behavior of actors engaged in the provision of invisible infrastructure in a way that can shed light on the root problems Principal-agent frameworks provide a natural way to model the provision of invisible infrastructure as involving a human chain of interlinked actors—upper tiers of management, or principals, delegate tasks to lower tiers of agents (Dixit 2002) In turn, agents at higher tiers often act as principals at lower tiers When we so decompose the state from monolith to interlocking principal-agent relationships, we can see failures like widespread corruption as localized malfunctions of particular links in the human chain The principal-agent framework allows us to model these malfunctions as agency problems the principal and agent may have different preferences, and weak information limits the principal’s ability to fully observe the agent’s action We can then approach policies to build invisible infrastructure for the poor as opportunities to solve a series of mechanism design problems, where efficient design requires understanding the political environment In the case of a democratic state providing services, the chain is often circular citizens delegate policymaking to elected leaders, who delegate tasks to senior administrators, who in turn delegate tasks to lower-level bureaucrats, who, finally, direct the activities of frontline service providers Ultimately, these providers often seek to influence the actions of citizens It is useful to visualize a human chain forming a circle with two sides a democratic side extending from the citizen up 14 Authors’ calculations using AidData (2017) Following Dietrich and Wright (2015), we classify governance and democracy aid as official development assistance to which AidData has assigned a Credit Reporting System purpose code beginning with 15 192  Journal of Economic Perspectives to the politician, and an implementation side stretching from the politician back down to the citizen The failure to align the incentives of actors along the chain with the preferences of citizens is often at the root of weak delivery of invisible infrastructure The human chain may be difficult to consider in the abstract, so we now give a series of concrete examples from a massive social protection program in a high-poverty middle-income country—the type of program states will need to execute successfully to draw their citizens out of extreme poverty Seeing the State as a Human Chain The Example of Workfare Program Reforms in India In 2005, India launched a federal workfare program—the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS)—that seeks to guarantee employment to the rural poor when they need it This large program (with a 2017–18 budget of over $7 billion) has historically been beset by significant corruption, though multiple program reforms appear to have reduced the leakage of funds over time (Imbert and Papp 2018) 15 In addition, the quality of MGNREGS implementation exhibits significant geographic variation Research on the effects of this program and the trends in its implementation provides multiple lessons on how aligning incentives and improving information flows can help"}
{"id": 916, "text": "in its implementation provides multiple lessons on how aligning incentives and improving information flows can help build states capable of delivering the invisible infrastructure First, it is crucial to ensure that information on reform reaches those with the will and ability to implement reforms Working in Bihar, one of India’s poorest states, Banerjee, Duflo, Imbert, Mathew, and Pande (2016) found that a new digital accounting system that cuts out administrative tiers lowered corruption and reduced MGNREGS program spending by 24 percent, with no detectable decline in payments to beneficiaries This was a positive result, but scaling up the reform required dealing with the entire human chain of the state, not just tuning up a single malfunctioning link The Bihar accounting reform first hit resistance from mid-tier administrators— those links in the chain who were being cut out—who lobbied against the reformed system The state government repealed it Eventually, the federal government—the program’s funder (and so the primary principal within the administration)—overrode that decision and rolled out the reform nationwide because it saved them money Thus, reform is more likely to be successful when actors higher up in the human chain with superior policy authority have both incentives to implement it well and access to independent information on program performance Second, it is necessary to align policy choices with the preferences and needs of the poor Again, Bihar’s reform experience is revealing A continuing shortcoming 15 Imbert and Papp (2018) compare MGNREGS employment in official reports to the estimated number of days spent by rural adults on any public works estimated based on National Sample Survey data They find that in 2007–2008 only 51 percent of reported MGNREGS employment was independently confirmed by the survey data They also find that this gap narrows over time to 71 percent in 2009–2010 and 80 percent in 2011–2012 Ending Global Poverty Why Money Isn’t Enough  193 of the digital accounting reform was that citizens did not directly benefit from reduced corruption the amount they earned from the workfare program remained unaffected, while implementation issues increased delays in their wage payments in the short term Furthermore, since citizens had no way of knowing that the modified system had cut leakage, they could not lobby for the money saved to be spent on more job opportunities through the program In contrast, a different reform of the employment guarantee scheme did translate into higher wages for the poor, arguably because citizens were directly engaged in and, therefore, well informed of the reform Muralidharan, Niehaus, and Sukhtankar (2016) demonstrate that investments in secure payment infrastructure for MGNREGS that directly included citizens—by altering how they obtain payments from banks—delivered a faster and less corrupt payment service while raising effective wages received by beneficiaries Third, leveraging the circular nature of the human chain in democratic settings can provide a powerful way of aligning incentives across the chain Specifically, a welldesigned human chain can ensure that elected politicians are incentivized to monitor administrators and verify that they provide services effectively Gulzar and Pasquale (2017) compare MGNREGS performance in districts where bureaucrats are supervised"}

We believe that achieving this goal within this timeframe will require substantial recalibration of efforts While economic growth has fueled large reductions in poverty over recent decades, further reductions will also require providing the “invisible infrastructure” that the poor need for economic mobility This provision can rely in part on aid and private players, but it will need to work principally through the domestic state Thus, eliminating absolute poverty will require investing in—not circumnavigating—domestic states, both in low-income countries and high-poverty middle-income countries It will also require empowering citizens to act as principals in demanding services from the state Lucy Page and Rohini Pande  195 How can international actors help? On the grand scale, international democracy assistance groups who focus on fair and free elections can coordinate activities with groups that seek to strengthen state capacity via greater administrative efficiency and transparency In low-income countries, aid should contribute to building effective, accountable state-run service delivery as much as possible In high-poverty middle-income countries, well-targeted technical assistance intended to support transparency and accountability initiatives can yield high returns Building sound invisible infrastructure will require working with individuals within the state who have the power and incentives to implement reform, and at the same time ensuring that poor citizens remain the ultimate principal In this spirit, we argue for research that unpacks the state and recognizes it as a chain of individuals, all acting on their own interest and responding to incentives  In recent decades, development economics has seen the emergence of an experimental literature that evaluates microeconomic policies one by one This has led to a robust discussion on the relationship between single-program evaluations and system-level change—whether, for example, a program that improved learning in a small number of schools can guide reforms on a country’s educational system (Alcott 2015 Bold, Kimenyi, Mwabu, Ng’ang’a, and Sandefur 2013) Some experts have suggested conducting experiments at the scale of the reform you"}

Surely their historical experience in transforming their economies from poor agricultural subsistence societies to modern industrial giants had important lessons for the “backward” countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America The logic and simplicity of these two strands of thought—the utility of massive injections of capital and the historical experience of the now developed countries—was too irresistible to be refuted by scholars, politicians, and administrators in rich countries, to whom people and ways of life in the developing world were often no more real than UN statistics or scattered chapters in anthropology books Because of its emphasis on the central role of accelerated capital accumulation, this approach is often dubbed “capital fundamentalism ” Rostow’s Stages of Growth The most influential and outspoken advocate of the stages-of-growth model of development was the American economic historian Walt W Rostow According to Rostow, the transition from underdevelopment to development can be described in terms of a series of steps or stages through which all countries must proceed As Rostow wrote in the opening chapter of The Stages of Economic Growth This book presents"}
{"id": 927, "text": "As Rostow wrote in the opening chapter of The Stages of Economic Growth This book presents an economic historian’s way of generalizing the sweep of modern history …It is possible to identify all societies, in their economic dimensions, as lying within one of five categories the traditional society, the preconditions for takeoff into self-sustaining growth, the take-off, the drive to maturity, and the age of high mass consumption …These stages are not merely descriptive They are not merely a way of generalizing certain factual observations about the sequence of development of modern societies They have an inner logic and continuity …They constitute, in the end, both a theory about economic growth and a more general, if still highly partial, theory about modern history as a whole 1 The advanced countries, it was argued, had all passed the stage of “takeoff into self-sustaining growth,” and the underdeveloped countries that were still in either the traditional society or the “preconditions” stage had only to follow a certain set of rules of development to take off in their turn into selfsustaining economic growth One of the principal strategies of development necessary for any takeoff was the mobilization of domestic and foreign saving in order to generate sufficient investment to accelerate economic growth The economic mechanism by which more investment leads to more growth can be described in terms of the Harrod-Domar growth model,2 today often referred to as the AK model because it is based on a linear production function with output given by the capital stock K times a constant, often labeled A In one form or another, it has frequently been applied to policy issues facing developing countries, such as in the two-gap model examined in Chapter 14 Stages-of-growth model of development A theory of economic development, associated with the American economic historian Walt W Rostow, according to which a country passes through sequential stages in achieving development Harrod-Domar growth model A functional economic relationship in which the growth rate of gross domestic product (g) depends directly on the national net savings rate (s) and inversely on the national capital-output ratio (c) 121 CHAPTER 3 Classic Theories of Economic Growth and Development The Harrod-Domar Growth Model Every economy must save a certain proportion of its national income, if only to replace worn-out or impaired capital goods (buildings, equipment, and materials) However, in order to grow, new investments representing net additions to the capital stock are necessary If we assume that there is some direct economic relationship between the size of the total capital stock, K, and total GDP, Y—for example, if $3 of capital is always necessary to produce an annual $1 stream of GDP—it follows that any net additions to the capital stock in the form of new investment will bring about corresponding increases in the flow of national output, GDP Suppose that this relationship, known in economics as the capital-output ratio, is roughly 3 to 1 If we define the capital-output ratio as k and assume further that the national net savings ratio, s, is a fixed proportion of national output"}

On strictly efficiency (as opposed to equity) criteria, there can be little doubt that market price allocation usually does a better job than state intervention The problem is that many developing economies are so different in structure and organization from their Western counterparts that the behavioral assumptions and policy precepts of traditional neoclassical theory are sometimes questionable and often incorrect Competitive free markets generally do not exist, nor, given the institutional, cultural, and historical context of many developing countries, would they necessarily be desirable from a long-term economic and social perspective (see Chapter 11) Consumers as a whole are rarely sovereign about what goods and services are to be produced, in what quantities, and for whom Information is limited, markets are fragmented, and much of the economy in low-income countries is still nonmonetized 17 There are widespread externalities of both production and consumption as well as discontinuities in production and indivisibilities (i e , economies of scale) in technology Producers, private or public, have great power in determining market prices and quantities sold The ideal of competition is typically just that—an ideal with little substance in reality Although monopolies of resource purchase and product sale are pervasive in the developing world, the traditional neoclassical theory of monopoly also offers little insight into the day-to-day activities of public and private corporations Decision rules can vary widely with the social setting so that profit maximization may be a lowpriority objective, especially in state-owned enterprises, in comparison with, say, the creation of jobs or the replacement of foreign managers with local personnel Finally, the invisible hand often acts not to"}

South Korea Stages of Growth South Korea confirms some linear-stages views, albeit in a limited way Its share of investment in national income has been among the highest in the world, and this is a crucial part of the explanation of the nation’s rapid ascent To understand just how rapid this ascent has been, consider that the country did not even rate a mention in Rostow’s Stages of Economic Growth in 1960, when the book was published, and few of the “preconditions for takeoff” were in place Investment has been very high since then, but as a share of GNI, the investment ratio, at 15%, was still below takeoff levels in 1965 Yet it rose dramatically to 37% of GNI by 1990 and remained close to 40% in the 2000–2007 period (though the ratio has fallen in the last few years) Still, South Korea’s ascent has seemed to epitomize Rostow’s notion of an economy in the midst of a “drive to maturity,” well on its way toward mastering the range of currently available technologies and appears to be entering an “age of high mass consumption ” Rostow claimed that maturity is attained some 60 years after takeoff begins, but he never denied unique experiences for each country, and it may well be that the gap between traditional and advanced technology can actually be crossed more quickly at later stages of development The larger the productivity gap is between countries, the quicker income can grow once takeoff has been achieved South Korea certainly meets the “maturity” criterion of becoming integrated with the world economy through new types of exports and imports Although the fact that India, rather than South Korea, was picked by Rostow for takeoff shows the limits of the predictive powers of the stages theory, the case of South Korea nonetheless offers some confirmation of their value Structural Patterns South Korea also confirms some patterns-of-development structural-change models In particular, South Korea’s rise over the past generation has been characterized by rapidly increasing"}

In the Marshallian supply-and-demand scissors diagram, equilibrium is found where the supply and demand curves cross In the multiple-equilibria diagram, equilibrium is found where the “privately rational decision function” (the S-shaped curve in Figure 4 1) crosses the 45-degree line This is because in these cases, agents observe what they expected to observe Suppose that firms expected no other firms to make investments, but some firms did anyway (implying a positive vertical intercept in the diagram) But then, seeing that some firms did make investments, it would not be reasonable to continue to expect no investment! Firms would have to revise their expectations upward, matching their expectations to the level of investment they actually would see But if firms now expected this higher level of investment, firms would want to invest even more This process of adjustment of expectations would continue until the level of actual investment would just equal the level of expected investment At that level, there would be no reason for firms to adjust their expectations any further So the general idea of an equilibrium in such cases is one in which all participants are doing what is best for them, given what they expect others to do, which in turn matches what others are actually doing This happens when the function crosses the 45-degree line At these points, the values on the x-axis and y-axis are equal, implying in our example that the level of investment expected is equal to the level that all agents find best (e g , the profit-maximizing level) D1 Y1 D2 D3 Privately rational decision (e g , individual investment level) Expected decision by other agents (e g , average investment level) Figure 4 1    Multiple Equilibria 170 PART one  Principles and Concepts In the diagram, the function cuts the 45-degree line three times Any of these points could be an equilibrium That is what we mean by the possibility of multiple equilibria Of the three, D1 and D3 are “stable” equilibria They are stable because if expectations were slightly changed to a little above or below these levels, firms would adjust their behavior—increase or decrease their investment levels—in"}

In other words, why not have a superentrepreneur who enters into all of the markets that need to be coordinated and receives the profits from all of them? For some types of coordination failures, this solution is ruled out in advance For example, regarding education and skill development, there is a legal constraint on bonded labor But in terms of our industrialization problem, why can’t one agent become a superentrepreneur in each of the N markets simultaneously? There are at least four significant theoretical answers and one decisive empirical answer First, there may be capital market failures How could one agent assemble all the capital needed to play the super-entrepreneur role? Even if this were logistically imaginable, how would lenders have confidence in their investments? In particular, how could a penalty for default be imposed? Second, there may be costs of monitoring managers and other agents and designing and implementing schemes to ensure compliance or provide incentives to follow the wishes of the employer these are often referred to as agency costs Monitoring is too expensive once the scale of a firm gets too large Even if the plan is to sell off the industries, these industries must be developed simultaneously The super-entrepreneur is likely to know more about the firms than the potential buyers do In other words, if the firm is so profitable, why would its owners be selling? Thus, potential purchasers of the industries face a problem of asymmetric information, often known as the “lemons problem ”34 Third, there may be communication failures Suppose someone says to you, “I am coordinating investments, so work with me ” Should you do so? Agency costs  Costs of monitoring managers and other employees and of designing and implementing schemes to ensure compliance or provide incentives to follow the wishes of the employer Asymmetric information  A situation in which one party to a potential transaction (often a buyer, seller, lender, or borrower) has more information than another party 183 CHAPTER 4  Contemporary Models of Development and Underdevelopment How do you know this person will eventually be the coordinator?

Even if each agent personally encounters only one pretender to the super-entrepreneur role, that pretender may still not be the right one (i e , the coordinator with whom you can make money) Fourth, there are limits to knowledge Even if we stipulate that the economy as a whole has access to modern technological ideas, this does not mean that one individual can gain sufficient knowledge to industrialize (or even gain enough knowledge about whom to hire to industrialize) Finally, there is the empirical reason that no private agent has been observed playing the role of super-entrepreneur Whether because of problems of monitoring, knowledge, capital markets, or other diseconomies of scope, “solving” problems with ever-larger firms clearly provides no answer For example, it is rare enough to find a firm producing steel and even a significant fraction of the products using steel, let alone one firm owning all the industries backwardly linked from steel or forwardly linked from steel-using industries to industries further down the production chain Nor can the problem be solved by direct government production (at least without unacceptable cost), as the extreme case of the former Soviet Union demonstrates Rather, public coordination of actions of private investors is generally needed to solve the problem, a common interpretation of the role of industrial policy in East Asia In a Nutshell  Thus we have seen that under some conditions, pecuniary externalities associated with the development process can lead to multiple equilibria, which may create a case for a big push policy Our main example (the moderate wage premium case) and each of the other examples have as a common feature a process by which an investing (industrializing) firm captures only part of the contribution of its investment to the profits of other investing firms In these examples, firms adopting increasing-returns-to-scale technologies are having one or more of the following effects raising total demand, shifting demand toward manufactured goods, redistributing demand toward the (later) periods in which other industrializing firms sell, reducing the fixed costs of later entrants, or helping defray the fixed costs of an essential infrastructure Each of these has external beneficial effects on other industrializing firms 4 4  Further Problems of Multiple Equilibria Inefficient Advantages of Incumbency The presence of increasing returns in modern industries can also create another kind of bad equilibrium Once a modern firm has entered, it has an advantage over any rivals because its large output gives it low average costs So if an even better modern technology becomes available to a potential rival, it may not be easy for the new technology to supplant the old Even though the new technique has a lower per-unit cost for any given level of output, the firm with the old technique has an advantage because its large output lets it 184 PART one  Principles and Concepts produce"}

Two points are crucial (1) Workers must be sufficiently imperfect substitutes for each other, and (2) we must have sufficient complementarity of tasks As long as these conditions hold, the basic results will follow 190 PART one  Principles and Concepts To see why workers must be imperfect substitutes, suppose they were perfect substitutes Specifically, suppose there are two skill levels, qL and qH = 2qL, so every qH worker can be replaced by two qL workers with no other change Thus qH workers will be paid twice the amount that qL workers are paid We can draw no predictions about what combination of worker skill levels a firm—or an economy—will use, so we can learn nothing about low-skill-level equilibrium traps In fact, there is empirical evidence for imperfect substitutability across worker types in firms To see why we must have complementarity of tasks, suppose that there were two tasks indexed by g and h but with no complementarity between them To be specific, suppose that our qH worker is hired for the g task, and a qL worker is hired for the h task then F(q Hq L) = g(q H) + h(q L) Here skills are imperfect substitutes for each other, because only one type of worker can be hired for each task (i e , no two-for-one type of substitution is possible here) However, because tasks are not complementary, the optimal choice of skill for the g task is independent of that of the h task, and again no strategic complementarities are present 46 Implications of the O-Ring Theory The analysis has several important implications Firms tend to employ workers with similar skills for their various tasks Workers performing the same task earn higher wages in a high-skill firm than in a low-skill firm Because wages increase in q at an increasing rate, wages will be more than proportionally higher in developed countries than would be predicted from standard measures of skill If workers can improve their skill level and"}

The basic decision tree for addressing this question is seen in Figure 4 3, with arrows leading to the ten bottom boxes (that is, the boxes from which no arrows extend further) At the first stage of the tree, the analyst seeks to divide countries between those for which the main problem is a low underlying rate of return and those for which the problem is an abnormally high cost of finance Let us consider the former case first, following the left arrow pointing to Low return to economic activity Low returns to investors may be due to the fact that there are intrinsically low underlying social returns to economic activities Alternatively, low returns may be caused by what is termed low private appropriability, meaning limited ability of investors to reap an adequate share of the rewards of their otherwise profitable investments Considering these cases in turn, low social returns may be caused by one of three factors First, as noted in Chapter 2, poor geography such as tropical pests, mountains, and other physical barriers, distance to world markets, and landlocked status (which may render port access politically dubious or economically costly) may limit the ability of a low-income country to initiate and sustain economic development, especially when other compounding factors are present When these constraints are most binding, development policy must initially focus on strategies for overcoming them Second, low human capital— skills and education as well as health of workers—are complementary with other factors in production, affecting the returns to economic activity For Growth diagnostics    A decision tree framework for identifying a country’s most binding constraints on economic growth Social returns  The profitability of an investment in which both costs and benefits are accounted for from the perspective of the society as a whole 194 PART one  Principles and Concepts example, if economic returns are most affected by lack of literacy and numeracy, this becomes a development policy priority (The importance of health and education was also stressed in Chapter 2, and this will"}

The answer, Stiglitz suggests, is that these officials found that by corrupting the process of privatization, they could get not only a stream of corrupt rents from the annual operations of the enterprise but also 199 CHAPTER 4  Contemporary Models of Development and Underdevelopment a share of the present discounted value of the whole future operations of the enterprise 53 The results of corrupt privatization in Russia in particular have been devastating for its economy, preventing it from enjoying the benefits of the market and potentially keeping it in a suboptimal equilibrium for many years to come Even when a government is not corrupt, the potential impact of a well-intentioned but flawed government policy is much greater when it can push the economy to a fundamentally different equilibrium, which may be difficult to reverse This is all the more problematic in the many cases in which “history matters” in a developing economy—that is, when past conditions determine what is possible today Both government failure and market failure (including coordination problems and information externalities) are real, but public- and private-sector contributions to development are also vital Therefore, we need to work toward the development of institutions in which actors in the public and private sectors have incentives to work productively together (directly and indirectly) in such a way as to create the conditions necessary to break out of poverty traps In achieving this goal, the international community also has a vital role to play, providing ideas and models and serving as a catalyst for change, as well as providing some of the necessary funding The growth diagnostics approach is a valuable tool for domestic and international analysts who start with a detailed understanding of a developing country it can be helpful in identifying binding constraints on national growth and the policy priorities to address them In sum, the contributions of the new theories of development reviewed in this chapter include a better understanding of the causes and effects of poverty traps, achieved by more precisely pinning down roles of different types of strategic complementarities, explaining the role of expectations, clarifying the importance of externalities, illuminating the potential scope for deep interventions, and improving our understanding of both the potential role of government and the constraints on the effectiveness of that role—when government itself becomes a player in an underdevelopment trap Finally, the new approaches point out more clearly the real potential contributions of outside development assistance that extend beyond provision of capital to modeling new ways of doing things As democratic government spreads in the developing world, the new understandings of underdevelopment traps can make for a more effective guide to policy design than was available even a few years ago As Karla Hoff has aptly summarized, “Governments fail, even in democracies, just as"}

And if so, in what ways? Success has a thousand fathers, and all the major traditional and new schools of thought on development want to claim China as their most important case in point China is hailed as an example of the benefits of markets, trade, and globalization Yet by conventional measures, institutions in China remain quite weak For example, the World Bank’s 2013 “Ease of Doing Business” index ranks China poorly, at No 96—worse than Russia, Mongolia, Zambia, or Serbia Manufactured exports are a key to China’s growth, and market incentives have played a primary motivational role in business decisions But China has also adopted activist industrial policies, pushing exports of increasingly higher skill and technology content, and it embarked on its period of rapid growth around 1980, more than a decade before significant trade liberalization But often overlooked is that China’s agricultural productivity growth was also very high Moreover, much of China’s growth in the 1980s and early 1990s was due to rural township and village enterprises, which had a quasi-cooperative and quasi-municipally owned character There has been less privatization of state-owned enterprises than in most developing countries In the meantime, countries in Africa, Latin America, and elsewhere that have most closely followed"}

In answering this question it is convenient to start with the identity that the proportionate rate of poverty reduction is the product of the “growth elasticity of poverty reduction” and the rate of growth Note that this is not the same as the elasticity of poverty with respect to the mean holding distribution constant (Kakwani, 1993) The latter can be thought of as the partial elasticity, as distinct from the total elasticity given by the proportionate rate of poverty reduction divided by the rate of growth Of course, if growth is distribution-neutral on  7 average then the two elasticities will be similar on average, though they may differ greatly in specific countries and time periods  Two factors can be identified as the main proximate causes of the differing total elasticities of poverty"}

There are a great many country-specific idiosyncratic factors (such as shocks to agricultural incomes, changes in trade regime, shifts in relative prices, tax reforms, welfare-policy reforms and changes in demographics) Generalizations across country experience are never easy, but one factor that is likely to matter in many developing countries is the geographic and sectoral pattern of growth The marked concentrations of poor people in specific regions and/or sectors that one finds in many countries point to the importance of the pattern of growth to overall poverty reduction The extent to which growth favors the rural sector is often key to its impact on aggregate poverty The geographic incidence of both rural and urban economic growth is often important  15 as well However, the extent to which the pattern of growth (rather than simply the overall growth rate) matters to the rate of poverty reduction is likely to vary from country to country, depending on (inter"}

Like many developing countries, living standards tend to be lower in rural areas than urban areas In the case of China, mean income is about 70% higher in urban areas (adjusted for cost-of-living differences) However, one does not find that inequality between urban and rural areas has shown a trend increase since reforms began, though there have been sub-periods (such as the late 1980s to the early 1990s) in which the urban-rural disparity rose over a number of years 18  To understand the rise in overall inequality one must understand what has happened within urban and rural areas, and particularly the latter, which naturally carries larger weight given that 60% of the population still live in rural areas, and that 80% did so at the outset of the reform period Indeed, around 1980, a staggering 98% of China’s poor lived in rural areas (Ravallion and Chen, 2004) While there are various ways (trade, migration, transfers) that nonfarm economic growth will spill over to the farm economy, the sheer weight of the rural sector in absolute poverty at the outset of China’s reform period means that agricultural and rural             17 This is the Ravallion-Chen (2003) “rate of pro-poor growth,” namely the mean growth rate of the poor This gives the change in the Watts index per unit time divided by the initial headcount index Notice that the mean growth rate of the poor is not the same thing as the growth rate in the mean for the poor, which will not in general be consistent with even the direction of change in any sensible measure of the level of poverty 18 An important difference with past results on this point is that Ravallion and Chen allowed for the fact that the rate of increase in the urban cost-of-living exceeded that for rural areas  19 economic growth would have been crucial This also carries an important lesson for other developing countries hoping to emulate China’s"}

{"id": 1051, "text": "same growth rate and no rise in inequality, the number of poor in China would be lower indeed, it would be less than one-quarter of its actual value (a poverty rate in 2001 of less than 1 5% rather than 8%) This calculation would clearly be deceptive if inequality rises with economic growth, as the “price” of that growth However, the evidence does not support that view On the other hand, the absence of such a trade-off also means that rising inequality put a serious brake on China’s pace of poverty reduction That is also borne out by the finding of Ravallion and Chen (2004) that the provinces that saw a more rapid rise in rural inequality saw less progress against poverty, not more As China’s policy makers now realize, it will be harder for China to maintain its past rate of progress against poverty without addressing the problem of rising inequality To the extent that recent history is any guide to the future, we can expect that the historically high levels of inequality found in many provinces today will inhibit future prospects of poverty reduction — just as we find that the provinces that started the reform period with relatively high inequality  24 faced a double handicap in future poverty reduction they had lower subsequent growth and the poor shared less in the gains from that growth Other factors point to the same conclusion It appears that aggregate economic growth in China is increasingly coming from sources that bring more limited gains to the poorest The low-lying fruit of efficiency-enhancing pro-poor reforms are possibly getting scarce Inequality is continuing to rise and poverty is becoming more responsive to rising inequality At the outset of China’s current transition period to a market economy, levels of poverty were so high that inequality was not an important concern That has changed It also appears that perceptions of what “poverty” means are evolving in China It can hardly be surprising to find that the standards that defined poverty 20 years ago have lost relevance to an economy that quadrupled its mean income over that period China could well be entering a stage of its development in which relative poverty emerges as a more important concern than in the past Economic growth will then be a blunter instrument for fighting poverty in the future India As in the case of China, it is clear that economic growth has tended to reduce poverty in India And, as in China, the poverty impact of accelerated growth in the 1990s has been dulled by rising inequality  Assessing what has been happening to inequality in India has been clouded by a comparability problem between the two main surveys available for the 1990s (Deaton, 2001 Datt and Ravallion, 2002) Figure 8 gives three estimates of the GIC for the 1990s The “unadjusted” estimate is based on the actual surveys with no attempt to correct for the comparability problem One of the other two is based on comparable distributions of  25 consumption per person based on a common “mixed"}
{"id": 1052, "text": "is based on comparable distributions of  25 consumption per person based on a common “mixed reference period” for categories of consumption as obtained by Sundaram and Tendulkar (2003) The other uses the alternative method of estimating a “common reference period” made by Deaton (2001) In all three cases, the rural and urban distributions are aggregated assuming urban-rural cost-of-living differentials of 33% and 38% for 1993/94 and 1999/00 respectively these are based on updated poverty lines as used in Ravallion and Datt (2002) Using either adjustment method, the GIC for the 1990s tends to show a U shape, with lowest growth rates for people around the 20th percentile Overall, the Gini index rose in the 1990s, by either adjustment method However, it is too early to say if this is going to be the similar to the trend increase in inequality that China has experienced Looking back over time, rising inequality in India is a recent phenomenon (Figure 9) (Longer term comparisons are only possible using the Deaton method of correcting for the comparability problem in the 1999/00 data ) As in China, India’s recent rise in inequality appears to have stemmed in part from geographic and sectoral imbalances in the growth process, evident as regional divergence and a lagging rural economy As in the case of China, one finds that growth in mean rural incomes has been far more effective against poverty in India (Table 1) and that the sectoral composition of growth has been important (Table 4), though tertiary sector growth was relatively more important in India than we find for China This could well reflect the difference between the two countries in the distribution of agricultural land, which is clearly more unequal in India, which naturally attenuates the impact of agricultural growth on poverty relative to that found in China By one estimate, if not for the sectoral and geographic imbalance of growth, the national rate of growth since reforms began in full force in the early 1990s would have generated a rate of poverty reduction that was double India’s historical trend rate (Datt and Ravallion, 2002) States  26 with relatively low levels of initial rural development and human capital development were not as well-suited to reducing poverty through economic growth  Higher average farm yields, higher public spending on development, higher (urban and rural) non-farm output and lower inflation were all poverty reducing (Ravallion and Datt, 2002) However, the response of poverty to non-farm output growth in India has varied significantly between states The differences reflect systematic differences in initial conditions Low farm productivity, low rural living standards relative to urban areas and poor basic education all inhibited the prospects of the poor participating in growth of the non-farm sector (Ravallion and Datt, 2002) Rural and human resource development appear to be strongly synergistic with poverty reduction through an expanding non-farm economy For example, non-farm economic growth in India has not occurred in the states where it would have the most impact on poverty nationally (Datt and Ravallion, 2002) This is clear from Figure 5, which plots"}

In addressing this question we must first confront a semantic point that has been a source of some confusion in recent development policy discussions “Pro-poor growth” has sometimes been taken to mean that poverty falls more than it would have if all incomes had grown at the same rate (Baulch and McCullock, 2000 Kakwani and Pernia, 2000) This definition focuses on the distributional shifts during the growth process roughly speaking, for growth to be deemed “pro-poor” the incomes of the poor should grow at a higher rate than those of the nonpoor By this definition, growth has not been pro-poor in either China or India (after adjusting for the comparability problem in the survey data noted above) In both countries, a distribution-neutral growth process would have had more impact on poverty than actually observed in the 1990s  However, it is surely problematic to identify a growth process as not being “pro-poor” when the poor benefit as much as they have in India and (especially) China As the experience of both countries has exemplified, rising inequality during a period of overall economic expansion can come with large absolute gains to the poor Similarly, a recession will be deemed pro-poor if poor people lose proportionately less than others, even though they are in fact worse off An alternative definition of “pro-poor growth” proposed by Ravallion"}

First we must be clear on the objective If we agree that poverty reduction is a far more important overall goal for development policy than reducing inequality per se then we should not accept redistributive policies that come at the expense of lower longer-term living standards for poor people Accepting that there is no aggregate trade-off between mean income and inequality does not mean that there are no trade-offs at the level of specific policies Reducing inequality by adding further distortions to an economy may well have ambiguous effects on growth and poverty reduction But nor should it be presumed that there will be such a trade-off with all redistributive policies The potential for “win-win” policies stems from the fact that some of the factors that impede growth also entail that the poor share less in the opportunities unleashed by growth  We have learnt that more rapid poverty reduction requires a combination of more growth, a more pro-poor pattern of growth and success in reducing the antecedent inequalities that limit the prospects for poor people to share in the opportunities unleashed by a growth economy  29 Even a distribution-neutral growth process — which hardly seems a high standard for “equitable growth” in high-inequality countries — can leave many poor people behind The challenge for future research is to better understand the specific factors that constrain some poor people from participating in the benefits of a growing economy, and to draw out the lessons for the"}
{"id": 1055, "text": "participating in the benefits of a growing economy, and to draw out the lessons for the types of policies that are needed for rapid poverty reduction in addition to promoting economic growth  A majority of the world’s poor still live in rural areas and this is likely to remain true for some time to come (Ravallion, 2002) It can be expected that agriculture and non-farm rural development will remain a high priority for sectoral policies However, past interventions have had a mixed record New approaches based on community-driven development have held promise but need careful monitoring and evaluation, recognizing the likely heterogeneity in performance across different institutional settings depending on how successful local elites are in capturing the gains (Mansuri and Rao, 2004 Galasso and Ravallion, 2005) The continuing existence of marked regional disparities in living standards has prompted renewed interest in explicit geographic dimensions in policy making, such as “poor-area programs” and attempts to set up “growth poles ” However, many questions remain Are infrastructure investments in poor areas (often with poor natural resources) effective in reducing poverty? Does it make more sense to move jobs to people, or people to jobs? Is there a trade-off between achieving greater regional equity — such as by focusing on areas with high poverty rates but low poverty densities — and poverty reduction in the aggregate? Recognizing that it is typically the poor rather than the rich who are locked out of profitable opportunities for self-advancement by the failures of markets and governments, interventions that make these institutions work better for poor people today can also help promote pro-poor growth in the future Successful policies can focus on either correcting the  30 underlying market and governmental failure or on directly intervening to redress the asset inequalities, by fostering accumulation of (physical and human) assets by poor people One can point to the potential importance of a wide range of policies including sound public investments in rural infrastructure, better policies for delivering quality health and education services to poor people, and policies that allow key product and factor markets (for land, labor and credit) to work better from the point of view of poor people The combination of interventions needed will naturally depend on country and regional circumstances There is still much we do not know about the most appropriate policy combinations in specific circumstances, although some pointers have emerged from research Making the provision of health and education services more responsive to the needs of poor people is likely to be crucial to achieving pro-poor growth in most settings (World Bank, 2004a) In rural economies, security of access to land through tenancy reform and titling programs is arguably no less important (World Bank, 2004b) In some circumstances, rural infrastructure development can also play a decisive role for example, research has revealed the importance of rural roads to achieving more pro-poor growth processes in rural China (Jalan and Ravallion, 2002) and that quite reasonable rates of return are possible from well-designed poor-area development programs (Ravallion and Chen, 2005) Better instruments for credit and"}

What determines the nature of economic growth—that is, who benefits from economic growth, and why? ! Are rapid economic growth and more equal income distribution compatible or conflicting objectives? ! Is rapid growth achievable only at a cost of greater income inequality or can lessening income disparities contribute to higher growth rates? ! Do the poor benefit from growth, and does this depend on the type of growth a developing country experiences? What might be done to help the poor benefit more? The Concept of Poverty ! Food (and nutrition) and shelter directly related to real income ! Health Social ! Infant mortality - Caste, gender ! General health - Freedoms ! Overall life expectancy ! Education Vulnerability ! Literacy - Probability of being exposed to any type of deprivation ! Skills We usually think of poverty as making less than a certain amount of income Poverty, however, has many dimensions Measuring poverty ! Participatory assessments ! Self identification challenges at household and individual levels ! Similar problems if federal funds depend on the number of poor ! “Scientific” Poverty Lines ! Different calorie requirements ! Men vs Women ! Urban vs Rural ! Composition of food matters ! Protein/Micronutrients ! Poverty measures !

Knowledge can spillover, grow and accumulate indefinitely It is only constrained by the number of people producing it ENDOGENOUS GROWTH THEORY ! Knowledge as a Non-Rival Good ! Knowledge is a non-rival good and can still be consumed by the seller even after it is sold ! Knowledge is also an excludable good A seller can exclude others from its consumption ! Enforced property rights (such as patents and copyrights), for example, prevent access to knowledge ! Such exclusions can be important because people and firms need to have an incentives (monopoly rents) to invest in research and development ! Imperfect competition is necessary to encourage growth (Recall that the Solow model assumes perfect competition ) ! A balance must be struck between granting temporary monopoly rights and promoting competition over the long run  ENDOGENOUS GROWTH THEORY ! Basic Equations of the Romer Model < Labor is divided between the productive sector (Y) and the research sector (A) (25) where human capital is the stock of knowledge at time t (At) times productive labor Lyt at time t ! The production function (26) ! Since knowledge (At) depends on the allocation of labor to research, it is endogenous to the model and can vary over time ! The increment of knowledge is given by the stock of knowledge multiplied by the labor force in the research sector and a parameter that can represent, say, the efficiency of research ENDOGENOUS GROWTH THEORY ! The Romer Model versus the Solow Model ! In the Romer Model, imperfect competition is necessary for innovation and growth, while the Solow model assumes perfect competition ! Innovation is endogenous in the Romer model, depending on stock of knowledge and the R D needed to build that knowledge Innovation is exogenous in the Solow model ! Romer predicts that rich countries should grow faster than poor countries because of a higher stock of knowledge (i e , divergence) Solow predicts that countries with low capital intensity should grow faster (convergence) ! Note the basic Romer model ignores possibilities of trade and technology transfer between rich and poor countries ! Are the protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) beneficial for poor countries?

Markets expand as transaction costs decrease Legal institutions, especially enforcement property rights, are necessary for market development ! The absence of modern communication technologies and insufficient transport infrastructure also presents problems for market development in developing countries ! Why did output fall when countries make the transition from central planning to a market economy? ! Farmers in developing countries often face monopsonies How does this affect incentives? How can these problems be alleviated? ! Market integration is when prices in different areas move together What are the obstacles to integration in developing countries? ! How does low market development and autocracy amplify the possibility of famine? INSTITUTIONS AND MARKET DEVELOPMENT Taking Markets for Granted ! When economists approached the transition economies they made the mistake of taking markets for granted ! Liberalized prices and elimination of central planning led to huge falls in output ! Information asymmetries, commitment issues, and other transaction costs mean that markets do not necessarily emerge smoothly ! Matching potential sellers with potential buyers can be difficult and markets do not readily reach the single equilibrium price ! Some markets develop with informal rules, but large scale is only possible with formal institutions such as rules and courts ! Quality communication and transportation infrastructure is also needed to reduce prohibitive transportation and marketing cost THE EMERGENCE OF MARKETS IN TRANSITION COUNTRIES The Output Fall In Central and Eastern Europe ! Economists were surprised to see that price liberalization led to large falls in output (See Table Below) If socialism was so inefficient, why did output fall so much in transition? ! Traditional price theory did not apply at this early stage Better answers were found in theories of contracts and institutions ! Blanchard and Kremer If and when a firm breaks an existing contract with the supplier, disruption occurs through the production chain In the absence of efficient institutions, key agents gain destructive bargaining power during the transition process !

In general, these transition problems mean a lower level of investment for a temporary though indefinite time frame THE EMERGENCE OF MARKETS IN TRANSITION COUNTRIES The Output Fall Real GDP Growth Rates in Central and Eastern Europe THE EMERGENCE OF MARKETS IN TRANSITION COUNTRIES China and the Dual-Track System ! Output did not fall when prices were liberalized in China It used “dualtrack liberalization” ! Fixed amount of a firm’s output is purchased and priced under the “plan track ” Extra production can be sold under market track at free market prices ! Since previous production arrangements were respected, no output fall took place, dynamic conditions were favorable for market expansion, competition and growth ! Conclusion Cannot view markets as simple supply and demand adjustments in established institutional framework Previous conditions and dynamic environment determine whether changes are accomplished with growth or contraction (path dependence) INSTITUTIONS AND MARKET DEVELOPMENT Specific Problems of Market Development in Poor Countries Legal system efficiency benefits greatly from economies of scale At early levels of development, however, markets are relatively small and expansion is difficult because 1 A small amount of commodities traded in markets means it is less worthwhile going to court to settle a business conflict 2 Penalties imposed by a court are not effective if there is no way to enforce them 3 Proof, such as signed contracts, are rare and courts often have to rely on witness testimony 4 There are higher costs of gathering and circulating information on supply, demand and price 5 Low population densities mean that transport infrastructure is often lacking 6 No standardized systems of weights and measures INSTITUTIONS AND MARKET DEVELOPMENT Business Networks in Development Relational contracting tends to play an important role in business dealings in developing countries Where more formal institutions and ample information does not exist, in general ! Buyers and sellers invest in long-term relationships and rely on others in their network for recommendations for other partners ! In some economies, religious and ethnic affiliations also play an important role in business relationships ! Entrepreneurs outside of these networks often have a difficult time entering the market ! There is considerable diversity in arrangements, which can often be traced to historic and cultural roots RURAL MARKETS AND THE MONOPSONY PROBLEM Monopsony and the Hold-Up Problem ! Monopsony (single buyer on a market) occurs often in rural markets because of small plots and high transportation costs ! Bargaining power and possibility of changing transaction terms produces underinvestment and slow productivity growth in farms ! Over the long run, the monopsonies can also suffer from farmers’ low productivity growth ! Monopsonies have been observed in Africa, Asia, and S America Possible solutions include !

So with strong complementarity it always pays to do assortative matching The “O-Ring” Theory Implications ! Firms tend to employ workers with similar skills for tasks !

(promoting the growth of particular sectors at the expense of others) Balanced and Unbalanced Growth ! With balanced growth sectors growing at the same pace, it reduces the possibility of bottlenecks (excess demand or excess supply) ! With unbalanced growth one or two key sectors are promoted Upstream and downstream industries which support the key sectors grow and develop through intersectoral linkages ! With backward linkages the key activity promotes development of upstream sectors (suppliers) Forward linkages from key industries promote downstream (customer) sectors ! Balanced growth makes sense in theory, but it assumes government has administrative capacity to promote it Unbalanced growth has proved to be more effective in practice (e g , Japan) DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES SECTORAL GROWTH Big Push Theories ! Big push theories promote the idea that development can be achieved only when government helps expand many sectors of the economy rapidly and simultaneously ! Stresses complementarities and coordination problems such as the need for public infrastructure to support private investment ! Some observers feel that the East Asian Miracle (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore) is at least partly due to close communication coordination between governments and the private sectors, and among complementary sectors such as steel and autos ! For example, development banks were used to channel capital to support growth of favored sectors, especially export-orientated firms !

Since the 1980s, however, the trend in terms of trade in developing countries has been virtually flat DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES TRADE Industrialization and the Protection of Infant Industries ! Dependence on primary commodity exports will lead to disappointing growth and development ! In the 19th century, Europe and the U S used tariff and other trade protections to industrialize !
