{"id":0,"text":"559 OCTOBER TERM, 1995 Syllabus BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE certiorari to the supreme court of alabama No 94–896 Argued October 11, 1995—Decided May 20, 1996 After respondent Gore purchased a new BMW automobile from an authorized Alabama dealer, he discovered that the car had been repainted He brought this suit for compensatory and punitive damages against petitioner, the American distributor of BMW’s, alleging, inter alia, that the failure to disclose the repainting constituted fraud under Alabama law At trial, BMW acknowledged that it followed a nationwide policy of not advising its dealers, and hence their customers, of predelivery damage to new cars when the cost of repair did not exceed 3 percent of the car’s suggested retail price Gore’s vehicle fell into that category The jury returned a verdict ﬁnding BMW liable for compensatory damages of $4,000, and assessing $4 million in punitive damages The trial judge denied BMW’s post-trial motion to set aside the punitive damages award, holding, among other things, that the award was not “grossly excessive” and thus did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment See, e g , TXO Production Corp v Alliance Resources Corp , 509 U S 443, 454 The Alabama Supreme Court agreed, but reduced the award to $2 million on the ground that, in computing the amount, the jury had improperly multiplied Gore’s compensatory damages by the number of similar sales in all States, not just those in Alabama Held The $2 million punitive damages award is grossly excessive and therefore exceeds the constitutional limit Pp 568–586 (a) Because such an award violates due process only when it can fairly be categorized as “grossly excessive” in relation to the State’s legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its repetition, cf TXO, 509 U S , at 456, the federal excessiveness inquiry appropriately begins with an identiﬁcation of the state interests that such an award is designed to serve Principles of state sovereignty and comity forbid a State to enact policies for the entire Nation, or to impose its own policy choice on neighboring States See, e g , Healy v Beer Institute, 491 U S 324, 335–336 Accordingly, the economic penalties that a State inﬂicts on those who transgress its laws, whether the penalties are legislatively authorized ﬁnes or judicially imposed punitive damages, must be supported by the State’s interest in protecting its own consumers and economy, rather than those of other States or the entire Nation Gore’s award must therefore be analyzed in the light of conduct that 560 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Syllabus occurred solely within Alabama, with consideration being given only to the interests of Alabama consumers Pp 568–574 (b) Elementary notions of fairness enshrined in this Court’s constitutional jurisprudence dictate that a person receive fair notice not only of the conduct that will subject him to punishment but also of the severity of the penalty that a State may impose Three guideposts, each of which indicates that BMW did not receive adequate notice of the magnitude of the sanction that Alabama might impose, lead to the conclusion that the $2 million award is grossly excessive Pp 574–575 (c) None of the aggravating factors associated with the ﬁrst (and perhaps most important) indicium of a punitive damages award’s excessiveness—the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant’s conduct, see, e g , Day v Woodworth, 13 How 363, 371—is present here The harm BMW inﬂicted on Gore was purely economic the presale repainting had no effect on the car’s performance, safety features, or appearance and BMW’s conduct evinced no indifference to or reckless disregard for the health and safety of others Gore’s contention that BMW’s nondisclosure was particularly reprehensible because it formed part of a nationwide pattern of tortious conduct is rejected, because a corporate executive could reasonably have interpreted the relevant state statutes as establishing safe harbors for nondisclosure of presumptively minor repairs, and because there is no evidence either that BMW acted in bad faith when it sought to establish the appropriate line between minor damage and damage requiring disclosure to purchasers, or that it persisted in its course of conduct after it had been adjudged unlawful Finally, there is no evidence that BMW engaged in deliberate false statements, acts of afﬁrmative misconduct, or concealment of evidence of improper motive Pp 575–580 (d) The second (and perhaps most commonly cited) indicium of excessiveness—the ratio between the plaintiff’s compensatory damages and the amount of the punitive damages, see, e g , TXO, 509 U S , at 459— also weighs against Gore, because his $2 million award is 500 times the amount of his actual harm as determined by the jury, and there is no suggestion that he or any other BMW purchaser was threatened with any additional potential harm by BMW’s nondisclosure policy Although it is not possible to draw a mathematical bright line between the constitutionally acceptable and the constitutionally unacceptable that would ﬁt every case, see, e g , id , at 458, the ratio here is clearly outside the acceptable range Pp 580–583 (e) Gore’s punitive damages award is not saved by the third relevant indicium of excessiveness—the difference between it and the civil or criminal sanctions that could be imposed for comparable misconduct, see, e g , Paciﬁc Mut Life Ins Co v Haslip, 499 U S 1, 23—because 561 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Syllabus $2 million is substantially greater than Alabama’s applicable $2,000 ﬁne and the penalties imposed in other States for similar malfeasance, and because none of the pertinent statutes or interpretive decisions would have put an out-of-state distributor on notice that it might be subject to a multimillion dollar sanction Moreover, in the absence of a BMW history of noncompliance with known statutory requirements, there is no basis for assuming that a more modest sanction would not have been sufﬁcient Pp 583–585 (f) Thus, BMW’s conduct was not sufﬁciently egregious to justify the severe punitive sanction imposed against it Whether the appropriate remedy requires a new trial or merely an independent determination by the Alabama Supreme Court of the award necessary to vindicate Alabama consumers’ economic interests is a matter for that court to address in the ﬁrst instance Pp 585–586 646 So 2d 619, reversed and remanded Stevens, J , delivered the opinion of the Court, in

pro se 563 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Opinion of the Court is whether a $2 million punitive damages award to the purchaser of one of these cars exceeds the constitutional limit I In January 1990, Dr Ira Gore, Jr (respondent), purchased a black BMW sports sedan for $40,750 88 from an authorized BMW dealer in Birmingham, Alabama After driving the car for approximately nine months, and without noticing any ﬂaws in its appearance, Dr Gore took the car to “Slick Finish,” an independent detailer, to make it look “ ‘snazzier than it normally would appear ’ ” 646 So 2d 619, 621 (Ala 1994) Mr Slick, the proprietor, detected evidence that the car had been repainted 1 Convinced that he had been cheated, Dr Gore brought suit against petitioner BMW of North America (BMW), the American distributor of BMW automobiles 2 Dr Gore alleged, inter alia, that the failure to disclose that the car had been repainted constituted suppression of a material fact 3 The complaint prayed for $500,000 in compensatory and punitive damages, and costs At trial, BMW acknowledged that it had adopted a nationwide policy in 1983 concerning cars that were damaged in the course of manufacture or transportation If the cost of repairing the damage exceeded 3 percent of the car’s sug1 The top, hood, trunk, and quarter panels of Dr Gore’s car were repainted at BMW’s vehicle preparation center in Brunswick, Georgia The parties presumed that the damage was caused by exposure to acid rain during transit between the manufacturing plant in Germany and the preparation center 2 Dr Gore also named the German manufacturer and the Birmingham dealership as defendants 3 Alabama codiﬁed its common-law cause of action for fraud in a 1907 statute that is still in effect Hackmeyer v Hackmeyer, 268 Ala 329, 333, 106 So 2d 245, 249 (1958) The statute provides “Suppression of a material fact which the party is under an obligation to communicate constitutes fraud The obligation to communicate may arise from the conﬁdential relations of the parties or from the particular circumstances of the case ” Ala Code §6–5–102 (1993) see Ala Code §4299 (1907) 564 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Opinion of the Court gested retail price, the car was placed in company service for a period of time and then sold as used If the repair cost did not exceed 3 percent of the suggested retail price, however, the car was sold as new without advising the dealer that any repairs had been made Because the $601 37 cost of repainting Dr Gore’s car was only about 1 5 percent of its suggested retail price, BMW did not disclose the damage or repair to the Birmingham dealer Dr Gore asserted that his repainted car was worth less than a car that had not been reﬁnished To prove his actual damages of $4,000, he relied on the testimony of a former BMW dealer, who estimated that the value of a repainted BMW was approximately 10 percent less than the value of a new car that had not been damaged and repaired 4 To support his claim for punitive damages, Dr Gore introduced evidence that since 1983 BMW had sold 983 reﬁnished cars as new, including 14 in Alabama, without disclosing that the cars had been repainted before sale at a cost of more than $300 per vehicle 5 Using the actual damage estimate of $4,000 per vehicle, Dr Gore argued that a punitive award of $4 million would provide an appropriate penalty for selling approximately 1,000 cars for more than they were worth In defense of its disclosure policy, BMW argued that it was under no obligation to disclose repairs of minor damage to new cars and that Dr Gore’s car was as good as a car with the original factory ﬁnish It disputed Dr Gore’s assertion that the value of the car was impaired by the repainting and argued that this good-faith belief made a punitive award inappropriate BMW also maintained that transactions in jurisdictions other than Alabama had no relevance to Dr Gore’s claim 4 The dealer who testiﬁed to the reduction in value is the former owner of the Birmingham dealership sued in this action He sold the dealership approximately one year before the trial 5 Dr Gore did not explain the signiﬁcance of the $300 cutoff 565 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Opinion of the Court The jury returned a verdict ﬁnding BMW liable for compensatory damages of $4,000 In addition, the jury assessed $4 million in punitive damages, based on a determination that the nondisclosure policy constituted “gross, oppressive or malicious” fraud 6 See Ala Code §§6–11–20, 6–11–21 (1993) BMW ﬁled a post-trial motion to set aside the punitive damages award The company introduced evidence to establish that its nondisclosure policy was consistent with the laws of roughly 25 States deﬁning the disclosure obligations of automobile manufacturers, distributors, and dealers The most stringent of these statutes required disclosure of repairs costing more than 3 percent of the suggested retail price none mandated disclosure of less costly repairs 7 Relying on these statutes, BMW contended that its conduct was lawful in these States and therefore could not provide the basis for an award of punitive damages BMW also drew the court’s attention to the fact that its nondisclosure policy had never been adjudged unlawful before this action was ﬁled Just months before Dr Gore’s case went to trial, the jury in a similar lawsuit ﬁled by another Alabama BMW purchaser found that BMW’s failure to disclose paint repair constituted fraud Yates v BMW of North America, Inc , 642 So 2d 937 (Ala 1993) 8 Before the 6 The jury also found the Birmingham dealership liable for Dr Gore’s compensatory damages and the German manufacturer liable for both the compensatory and punitive damages The dealership did not appeal the judgment against it The Alabama Supreme Court held that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the German manufacturer and therefore reversed the judgment against that defendant 7 BMW acknowledged that a Georgia statute enacted after Dr Gore purchased his car would require disclosure of similar repairs to a car before it was sold in Georgia Ga Code Ann §§40–1–5(b)–(e) (1994) 8 While awarding a comparable amount of compensatory damages, the Yates jury awarded no punitive damages at all In Yates, the plaintiff also relied on the 1983 nondisclosure policy, but instead of offering evidence of 983 repairs costing more than $300 each, he introduced a bulk exhibit 566 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Opinion of the Court judgment in this case, BMW changed its policy by taking steps to avoid the sale of any reﬁnished vehicles in Alabama and two other States When the $4 million verdict was returned in this case, BMW promptly instituted a nationwide policy of full disclosure of all repairs, no matter how minor In response to BMW’s arguments, Dr Gore asserted that the policy change demonstrated the efﬁcacy of the punitive damages award He noted that while no jury had held the policy unlawful, BMW had received a number of customer complaints relating to undisclosed repairs and had settled some lawsuits 9 Finally, he maintained that the disclosure statutes of other States were irrelevant because BMW had failed to offer any evidence that the disclosure statutes supplanted, rather than supplemented, existing causes of action for common-law fraud The trial judge denied BMW’s post-trial motion, holding, inter alia, that the award was not excessive On appeal, the Alabama Supreme Court also rejected BMW’s claim that the award exceeded the constitutionally permissible amount 646 So 2d 619 (1994) The court’s excessiveness inquiry applied the factors articulated in Green Oil Co v Hornsby, 539 So 2d 218, 223–224 (Ala 1989), and approved in Paciﬁc Mut Life Ins Co v Haslip, 499 U S 1, 21–22 (1991) 646 So 2d, at 624–625 Based on its analysis, the court concluded that BMW’s conduct was “reprehensible” the nondisclosure was proﬁtable for the company the judgment “would not have a substantial impact upon [BMW’s] ﬁnancial position” the litigation had been expensive no criminal sanctions had been imposed on BMW for the same conduct the award of no pucontaining 5,856 repair bills to show that petitioner had sold over 5,800 new BMW vehicles without disclosing that they had been repaired 9 Prior to the lawsuits ﬁled by Dr Yates and Dr Gore, BMW and various BMW dealers had been sued 14 times concerning presale paint or damage repair According to the testimony of BMW’s in-house counsel at the postjudgment hearing on damages, only one of the suits concerned a car repainted by BMW 567 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Opinion of the Court nitive damages in Yates reﬂected “the inherent uncertainty of the trial process” and the punitive award bore a “reasonable relationship” to “the harm that was likely to occur from [BMW’s] conduct as well as  the harm that actually occurred ” 646 So 2d, at 625–627 The Alabama Supreme Court did, however, rule in BMW’s favor on one critical point The court found that the jury improperly computed the amount of punitive damages by multiplying Dr Gore’s compensatory damages by the number of similar sales in other jurisdictions Id , at 627 Having found the verdict tainted, the court held that “a constitutionally reasonable punitive damages award in this case is $2,000,000,” id , at 629, and therefore ordered a remittitur in that amount 10 The court’s discussion of the amount of its remitted award expressly disclaimed any reliance on “acts that occurred in other jurisdictions” instead, the court explained that it had used a “comparative analysis” that considered Alabama cases, “along with cases from other jurisdictions, involving the sale of an automobile where the seller misrepresented the condition of the vehicle and the jury awarded punitive damages to the purchaser ” 11 Id , at 628 10 The Alabama Supreme Court did not indicate whether the $2 million ﬁgure represented the court’s independent assessment of the appropriate level of punitive damages, or its determination of the maximum amount that the jury could have awarded consistent with the Due Process Clause 11 Other than Yates v BMW of North America, Inc , 642 So 2d 937 (1993), in which no punitive damages were awarded, the Alabama Supreme Court cited no such cases In another portion of its opinion, 646 So 2d, at 629, the court did cite ﬁve Alabama cases, none of which involved either a dispute arising out of the purchase of an automobile or an award of punitive damages G M Mosley Contractors, Inc v Phillips, 487 So 2d 876, 879 (1986) Hollis v Wyrosdick, 508 So 2d 704 (1987) Campbell v Burns, 512 So 2d 1341, 1343 (1987) Ashbee v Brock, 510 So 2d 214 (1987) and Jawad v Granade, 497 So 2d 471 (1986) All of these cases support the proposition that appellate courts in Alabama presume that jury verdicts are correct In light of the Alabama Supreme Court’s conclusion that (1) the jury had computed its award by multiplying $4,000 by the number of reﬁnished vehicles sold in the United States and 568 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Opinion of the Court Because we believed that a review of this case would help to illuminate “the character of the standard that will identify unconstitutionally excessive awards” of punitive damages, see Honda Motor Co v Oberg, 512 U S 415, 420 (1994), we granted certiorari, 513 U S 1125 (1995) II Punitive damages may properly be imposed to further a State’s legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its repetition Gertz v Robert Welch, Inc , 418 U S 323, 350 (1974) Newport v Fact Concerts, Inc , 453 U S 247, 266–267 (1981) Haslip, 499 U S , at 22 In our federal system, States necessarily have considerable ﬂexibility in determining the level of punitive damages that they will allow in different classes of cases and in any particular case Most States that authorize exemplary damages afford the jury similar latitude, requiring only that the damages awarded be reasonably necessary to vindicate the State’s legitimate interests in punishment and deterrence See TXO, 509 U S , at 456 Haslip, 499 U S , at 21, 22 Only when an award can fairly be categorized as “grossly excessive” in relation to these interests does it enter the zone of arbitrariness that violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment Cf TXO, 509 U S , at 456 For that reason, the federal excessiveness inquiry appropriately begins with an identiﬁcation of the state interests that a punitive award is designed to serve We therefore focus our attention ﬁrst on the scope of Alabama’s legitimate interests in punishing BMW and deterring it from future misconduct No one doubts that a State may protect its citizens by prohibiting deceptive trade practices and by requiring auto(2) that the award should have been based on Alabama conduct, respect for the error-free portion of the jury verdict would seem to produce an award of $56,000 ($4,000 multiplied by 14, the number of repainted vehicles sold in Alabama) 569 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Opinion of the Court mobile distributors to disclose presale repairs that affect the value of a new car But the States need not, and in fact do not, provide such protection in a uniform manner Some States rely on the judicial process to formulate and enforce an appropriate disclosure requirement by applying principles of contract and tort law 12 Other States have enacted various forms of legislation that deﬁne the disclosure obligations of automobile manufacturers, distributors, and dealers 13 12 See, e g , Rivers v BMW of North America,

§§40–1– 5(b)–(e) (1994) (enacted after respondent purchased his car) Florida re 570 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Opinion of the Court The result is a patchwork of rules representing the diverse policy judgments of lawmakers in 50 States That diversity demonstrates that reasonable people may disagree about the value of a full disclosure requirement Some legislatures may conclude that afﬁrmative disclosure requirements are unnecessary because the self-interest of those involved in the automobile trade in developing and maintaining the goodwill of their customers will motivate them to make voluntary disclosures or to refrain from selling cars that do not comply with self-imposed standards Those legislatures that do adopt afﬁrmative disclosure obligations may take into account the cost of government regulation, choosing to draw a line exempting minor repairs from such a requirement In formulating a disclosure standard, States may also consider other goals, such as providing a “safe harbor” for automobile manufacturers, distributors, and dealers against lawsuits over minor repairs 14 We may assume, arguendo, that it would be wise for every State to adopt Dr Gore’s preferred rule, requiring full disclosure of every presale repair to a car, no matter how trivial and regardless of its actual impact on the value of the car quires dealers to disclose paint repair costing more than $100 of which they have actual knowledge Fla Stat §320 27(9)(n) (1992) Oregon requires manufacturers to disclose all “postmanufacturing” damage and repairs It is unclear whether this mandate would apply to repairs such as those at issue here Ore Rev Stat §650 155 (1991) Many, but not all, of the statutes exclude from the computation of repair cost the value of certain components—typically items such as glass, tires, wheels and bumpers—when they are replaced with identical manufacturer’s original equipment E g , Cal Veh Code Ann §§9990–9991 (West Supp 1996) Ga Code

residents 571 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Opinion of the Court But while we do not doubt that Congress has ample authority to enact such a policy for the entire Nation,15 it is clear that no single State could do so, or even impose its own policy choice on neighboring States See Bonaparte v Tax Court, 104 U S 592, 594 (1881) (“No State can legislate except with reference to its own jurisdiction  Each State is independent of all the others in this particular”) 16 Similarly, one State’s power to impose burdens on the interstate market for automobiles is not only subordinate to the federal power over interstate commerce, Gibbons v Ogden, 9 Wheat 1, 194–196 (1824), but is also constrained by the need to respect the interests of other States, see, e g , Healy v Beer Institute, 491 U S 324, 335–336 (1989) (the Constitution has a “special concern both with the maintenance of a national economic union unfettered by state-imposed limitations on 15 Federal disclosure requirements are, of

that it has rarely been called in question and hence authorities directly dealing with it do not abound”) Huntington v Attrill, 146 U S 657, 669 (1892) (“Laws have no force of themselves beyond the

sovereignty and comity that a State may not impose economic sanctions on violators of its laws with the intent of changing the tortfeasors’ lawful conduct in other States 17 Before this Court Dr Gore argued that the large punitive damages award was necessary to induce BMW to change the nationwide policy that it adopted in 1983 18 But by attempting to alter BMW’s nationwide policy, Alabama would be infringing on the policy choices of other States To avoid such encroachment, the economic penalties that a State such as Alabama inﬂicts on those who transgress its laws, whether the penalties take the form of legislatively authorized ﬁnes or judicially imposed punitive damages, must be supported by the State’s interest in protecting its own consumers and its own economy Alabama may insist that BMW adhere to a particular disclosure policy in that State Alabama does not 17 State power may be exercised as much by a jury’s application of a state rule of law in a civil lawsuit as by a statute See New York Times Co v Sullivan, 376 U S 254, 265 (1964) (“The test is not the form in which state power has been applied but, whatever the form, whether such power has in fact been exercised”) San Diego Building Trades Council v Garmon, 359 U S 236, 247 (1959) (“[R]egulation can be as effectively exerted through an award of damages as through some form of preventive relief”) 18 Brief for Respondent 11–12, 23, 27–28 Tr of Oral Arg 50–54 Dr Gore’s interest in altering the nationwide policy stems from his concern that BMW would not (or could not) discontinue the policy in Alabama alone Brief for Respondent 11 “If Alabama were limited to imposing punitive damages based only on BMW’s gain from fraudulent sales in Alabama, the resulting award would have no prospect of protecting Alabama consumers from fraud, as it would provide no incentive for BMW to alter the unitary, national policy of nondisclosure which yielded BMW millions of dollars in proﬁts ” Id , at 23 The record discloses no basis for Dr Gore’s contention that BMW could not comply with Alabama’s law without changing its nationwide policy 573 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Opinion of the Court have the power, however, to punish BMW for conduct that was lawful where it occurred and that had no impact on Alabama or its residents 19 Nor may Alabama impose sanctions on BMW in order to deter conduct that is lawful in other jurisdictions In this case, we accept the Alabama Supreme Court’s interpretation of the jury verdict as reﬂecting a computation of the amount of punitive damages “based in large part on conduct that happened in other jurisdictions ” 646 So 2d, at 627 As the Alabama Supreme Court noted, neither the jury nor the trial court was presented with evidence that any of BMW’s out-of-state conduct was unlawful “The only testimony touching the issue showed that approximately 60% of the vehicles that were reﬁnished were sold in states where failure to disclose the repair was not an unfair trade practice ” Id , at 627, n 6 20 The Alabama Supreme Court therefore properly eschewed reliance on BMW’s out-of-state conduct, id , at 628, and based its remitted award solely on 19 See Bordenkircher v Hayes, 434 U S 357, 363 (1978) (“To punish a person because he has done what the law plainly allows him to do is a due process violation of the most basic sort”) Our cases concerning recidivist statutes are not to the contrary Habitual offender statutes permit the sentencing court to enhance a defendant’s punishment for a crime in light of prior convictions, including convictions in foreign jurisdictions See e g , Ala Code §13A–5–9 (1994) Cal Penal Code Ann §§667 5(f), 668 (West Supp 1996) Ill Comp Stat , ch 720, §5/33B–1 (1994) N Y Penal Law §§70 04, 70 06, 70 08, 70 10 (McKinney 1987 and Supp 1996) Tex Penal Code Ann §12 42 (1994 and Supp 1995–1996) A sentencing judge may even consider past criminal behavior which did not result in a conviction and lawful conduct that bears on the defendant’s character and prospects for rehabilitation Williams v New York, 337 U S 241 (1949) But we have never held that a sentencing court could properly punish lawful conduct This distinction is precisely the one we draw here See n 21, infra 20 Given that the verdict was based in part on out-of-state conduct that was lawful where it occurred, we need not consider whether one State may properly attempt to change a tortfeasor’s unlawful conduct in another State 574 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Opinion of the Court conduct that occurred within Alabama 21 The award must be analyzed in the light of the same conduct, with consideration given only to the interests of Alabama consumers, rather than those of the entire Nation When the scope of the interest in punishment and deterrence that an Alabama court may appropriately consider is properly limited, it is apparent—for reasons that we shall now address—that this award is grossly excessive III Elementary notions of fairness enshrined in our constitutional jurisprudence dictate that a person receive fair notice not only of the conduct that will subject him to punishment, but also of the severity of the penalty that a State may impose 22 Three guideposts, each of which indicates that BMW did not receive adequate notice of the magnitude of the sanction that Alabama might impose for adhering to the nondisclosure policy adopted in 1983, lead us to the conclusion that 21 Of course, the fact that the Alabama Supreme Court correctly concluded that it was error for the jury to use the number of sales in other States as a multiplier in computing the amount of its punitive sanction does not mean that evidence describing out-of-state transactions is irrelevant in a case of this kind To the contrary, as we stated in TXO Production Corp v Alliance Resources Corp , 509 U S 443, 462, n 28 (1993), such evidence may be relevant to the determination of the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant’s conduct 22 See Miller v Florida, 482 U S 423 (1987) (Ex Post Facto Clause violated by retroactive imposition of revised sentencing guidelines that provided longer sentence for defendant’s crime) Bouie v City of Columbia, 378 U S 347 (1964) (retroactive application of new construction of statute violated due process) id , at 350–355 (citing cases) Lankford v Idaho, 500 U S 110 (1991) (due process violated because defendant and his counsel did not have adequate notice that judge might impose death sentence) The strict constitutional safeguards afforded to criminal defendants are not applicable to civil cases, but the basic protection against “judgments without notice” afforded by the Due Process Clause, Shaffer v Heitner, 433 U S 186, 217 (1977) (Stevens, J , concurring in judgment), is implicated by civil penalties 575 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Opinion of the Court the $2 million award against BMW is grossly excessive the degree of reprehensibility of the nondisclosure the disparity between the harm or potential harm suffered by Dr Gore and his punitive damages award and the difference between this remedy and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases We discuss these considerations in turn Degree of Reprehensibility Perhaps the most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant’s conduct 23 As the Court stated nearly 150 years ago, exemplary damages imposed on a defendant should reﬂect “the enormity of his offense ” Day v Woodworth, 13 How 363, 371 (1852) See also St Louis, I M S R Co v Williams, 251 U S 63, 66–67 (1919) (punitive award may not be “wholly disproportioned to the offense”) Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt , Inc v Kelco Disposal, Inc , 492 U S 257, 301 (1989) (O’Connor, J , concurring in part and dissenting in part) (reviewing court “should examine the gravity of the defendant’s conduct and the harshness of the award of punitive damages”) 24 This principle reﬂects the accepted view that some wrongs are more blameworthy than others Thus, we have said that 23 “The ﬂagrancy of the misconduct is thought to be the primary consideration in determining the amount of punitive damages ” Owen, A Punitive Damages Overview Functions, Problems and Reform, 39 Vill L Rev 363, 387 (1994) 24 The principle that punishment should ﬁt the crime “is deeply rooted and frequently repeated in common-law jurisprudence ” Solem v Helm, 463 U S 277, 284 (1983) See Burkett v Lanata, 15 La Ann 337, 339 (1860) (punitive damages should be “commensurate to the nature of the offence”) Blanchard v Morris, 15 Ill 35, 36 (1853) (“[W]e cannot say [the exemplary damages] are excessive under the circumstances for the proofs show that threats, violence, and imprisonment, were accompanied by mental fear, torture, and agony of mind”) Louisville Northern R Co v Brown, 127 Ky 732, 749, 106 S W 795, 799 (1908) (“We are not aware of any case in which the court has sustained a verdict as large as this one unless the injuries were permanent”) 576 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Opinion of the Court “nonviolent crimes are less serious than crimes marked by violence or the threat of violence ” Solem v Helm, 463 U S 277, 292–293 (1983) Similarly, “trickery and deceit,” TXO, 509 U S , at 462, are more reprehensible than negligence In TXO, both the West Virginia Supreme Court and the Justices of this Court placed special emphasis on the principle that punitive damages may not be “grossly out of proportion to the severity of the offense ” 25 Id , at 453, 462 Indeed, for Justice Kennedy, the defendant’s intentional malice was the decisive element in a “close and difﬁcult” case Id , at 468 26 In this case, none of the aggravating factors associated with particularly reprehensible conduct is present The harm BMW inﬂicted on Dr Gore was purely economic in nature The presale reﬁnishing of the car had no effect on its performance or safety features, or even its appearance for at least nine months after his purchase BMW’s conduct evinced no indifference to or reckless disregard for the health and safety of others To be sure, inﬂiction of economic injury, especially when done intentionally through afﬁrmative acts of misconduct, id , at 453, or when the target is ﬁnancially vulnerable, can warrant a substantial penalty But this observation does not convert all acts that cause economic harm into torts that are sufﬁciently reprehensible to justify a signiﬁcant sanction in addition to compensatory damages Dr Gore contends that BMW’s conduct was particularly reprehensible because nondisclosure of the repairs to his car formed part of a nationwide pattern of tortious conduct Certainly, evidence that a defendant has repeatedly engaged in prohibited conduct while knowing or suspecting that it was unlawful would provide relevant support for an argu25 Paciﬁc Mut Life Ins Co v Haslip, 499 U S 1, 22 (1991) 26 The dissenters also recognized that “TXO’s conduct was clearly wrongful, calculated, and improper  ” TXO, 509 U S , at 482 (opinion of O’Connor, J ) 577 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Opinion of the Court ment that strong medicine is required to cure the defendant’s disrespect for the law See id , at 462, n 28 Our holdings that a recidivist may be punished more severely than a ﬁrst offender recognize that repeated misconduct is more reprehensible than an individual instance of malfeasance See Gryger v Burke, 334 U S 728, 732 (1948) In support of his thesis, Dr Gore advances two arguments First, he asserts that the state disclosure statutes supplement, rather than supplant, existing remedies for breach of contract and common-law fraud Thus, according to Dr Gore, the statutes may not properly be viewed as immunizing from liability the nondisclosure of repairs costing less than the applicable statutory threshold Brief for Respondent 18–19 Second, Dr Gore maintains that BMW should have anticipated that its failure to disclose similar repair work could expose it to liability for fraud Id , at 4–5 We recognize, of course, that only state courts may authoritatively construe state statutes As far as we are aware, at the time this action was commenced no state court had explicitly addressed whether its State’s disclosure statute provides a safe harbor for nondisclosure of presumptively minor repairs or should be construed instead as supplementing common-law duties 27 A review of the text of the stat27 In Jeter v M M Dodge, Inc , 634 So 2d 1383 (La App 1994), a Louisiana Court of Appeals suggested that the Louisiana disclosure statute functions as a safe harbor Finding that the cost of repairing presale damage to the plaintiff’s car exceeded the statutory disclosure threshold, the court held that the disclosure statute did not provide a defense to the action Id , at 1384 During the pendency of this litigation, Alabama enacted a disclosure statute which deﬁnes “material” damage to a new car as damage requiring repairs costing in excess of 3 percent of suggested retail price or $500, whichever is greater Ala Code §8–19–5(22) (1993) After its decision in this case, the Alabama Supreme Court stated in dicta that the remedies available under this section of its Deceptive Trade Practices Act did not displace or alter pre-existing remedies available under either the common law or other statutes Hines v Riverside Chevrolet-Olds, Inc , 655 So 2d 909, 917, n 2 (1994) It refused, however, to “recognize, or impose on 578 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Opinion of the Court utes, however, persuades us that in the absence of a statecourt determination to the contrary, a corporate executive could reasonably interpret the disclosure requirements as establishing safe harbors In California, for example, the disclosure statute deﬁnes “material” damage to a motor vehicle as damage requiring repairs costing in excess of 3 percent of the suggested retail price or $500, whichever is greater Cal Veh Code Ann §9990 (West Supp 1996) The Illinois statute states that in cases in which disclosure is not required, “nondisclosure does not constitute a misrepresentation or omission of fact ” Ill Comp Stat , ch 815, §710/5 (1994) 28 Perhaps the statutes may also be interpreted in another way We simply emphasize that the record contains no evidence that BMW’s decision to follow a disclosure policy that coincided with the strictest extant state statute was sufﬁciently reprehensible to justify a $2 million award of punitive damages automobile manufacturers, a general duty to disclose every repair of damage, however slight, incurred during the manufacturing process ” Id , at 921 Instead, it held that whether a defendant has a duty to disclose is a question of fact “for the jury to determine ” Id , at 918 In reaching that conclusion it overruled two earlier decisions that seemed to indicate that as a matter of law there was no disclosure obligation in cases comparable to this one Id , at 920 (overruling Century 21-Reeves Realty, Inc v McConnell Cadillac, Inc , 626 So 2d 1273 (1993), and Cobb v Southeast Toyota Distributors, Inc , 569 So 2d 395 (1990)) 28 See also Ariz Rev Stat Ann §28–1304 03 (1989) (“[I]f disclosure is not required under this section, a purchaser may not revoke or rescind a sales contract due solely to the fact that the new motor vehicle was damaged and repaired prior to completion of the sale”) Ind Code §9–23–4–5 (1993) (providing that “[r]epaired damage to a customer-ordered new motor vehicle not exceeding four percent (4%) of the manufacturer’s suggested retail price does not need to be disclosed at the time of sale”) N C Gen Stat §20–305 1(e) (1993) (requiring disclosure of repairs costing more than 5 percent of suggested retail price and prohibiting revocation or rescission of sales contract on the basis of less costly repairs) Okla Stat , Tit 47, §1112 1 (1991) (deﬁning “material” damage to a car as damage requiring repairs costing in excess of 3 percent of suggested retail price or $500, whichever is greater) 579 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Opinion of the Court Dr Gore’s second argument for treating BMW as a recidivist is that the company should have anticipated that its actions would be considered fraudulent in some, if not all, jurisdictions This contention overlooks the fact that actionable fraud requires a material misrepresentation or omission 29 This qualiﬁer invites line-drawing of just the sort engaged in by States with disclosure statutes and by BMW We do not think it can be disputed that there may exist minor imperfections in the ﬁnish of a new car that can be repaired (or indeed, left unrepaired) without materially affecting the car’s value 30 There is no evidence that BMW acted in bad faith when it sought to establish the appropriate line between presumptively minor damage and damage requiring disclosure to purchasers For this purpose, BMW could reasonably rely on state disclosure statutes for guidance In this regard, it is also signiﬁcant that there is no evidence that BMW persisted in a course of conduct after it had been adjudged unlawful on even one occasion, let alone repeated occasions 31 Finally, the record in this case discloses no deliberate false statements, acts of afﬁrmative misconduct, or concealment of evidence of improper motive, such as were present in Haslip and TXO Haslip, 499 U S , at 5 TXO, 509 U S , at 453 We accept, of course, the jury’s ﬁnding that BMW suppressed 29 Restatement (Second) of Torts §538 (1977) W Keeton, D Dobbs, R Keeton, D Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts §108 (5th ed 1984) 30 The Alabama Supreme Court has held that a car may be considered “new” as a matter of law even if its ﬁnish contains minor cosmetic ﬂaws Wilburn v Larry Savage Chevrolet, Inc , 477 So 2d 384 (1985) We note also that at trial respondent only introduced evidence of undisclosed paint damage to new cars repaired at a cost of $300 or more This decision suggests that respondent believed that the jury might consider some repairs too de minimis to warrant disclosure 31 Before the verdict in this case, BMW had changed its policy with respect to Alabama and two other States Five days after the jury award, BMW altered its nationwide policy to one of full disclosure 580 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Opinion of the Court a material fact which Alabama law obligated it to communicate to prospective purchasers of repainted cars in that State But the omission of a material fact may be less reprehensible than a deliberate false statement, particularly when there is a good-faith basis for believing that no duty to disclose exists That conduct is sufﬁciently reprehensible to give rise to tort liability, and even a modest award of exemplary damages does not establish the high degree of culpability that warrants a substantial punitive damages award Because this case exhibits none of the circumstances ordinarily associated with egregiously improper conduct, we are persuaded that BMW’s conduct was not sufﬁciently reprehensible to warrant imposition of a $2 million exemplary damages award Ratio The second and perhaps most commonly cited indicium of an unreasonable or excessive punitive damages award is its ratio to the actual harm inﬂicted on the plaintiff See TXO, 509 U S , at 459 Haslip, 499 U S , at 23 The principle that exemplary damages must bear a “reasonable relationship” to compensatory damages has a long pedigree 32 Scholars have identiﬁed a number of early English statutes authorizing the 32 See, e g , Grant v McDonogh, 7 La Ann 447, 448 (1852) (“[E]xemplary damages allowed should bear some proportion to the real damage sustained”) Saunders v Mullen, 66 Iowa 728, 729, 24 N W 529 (1885) (“When the actual damages are so small, the amount allowed as exemplary damages should not be so large”) Flannery v Baltimore Ohio R Co , 15 D C 111, 125 (1885) (when punitive damages award “is out of all proportion to the injuries received, we feel it our duty to interfere”) Houston Texas Central R Co v Nichols, 9 Am Eng R R Cas 361, 365 (Tex 1882) (“Exemplary damages, when allowed, should bear proportion to the actual damages sustained”) McCarthy v Niskern, 22 Minn 90, 91–92 (1875) (punitive damages “enormously in excess of what may justly be regarded as compensation” for the injury must be set aside “to prevent injustice”) 581 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Opinion of the Court award of multiple damages for particular wrongs Some 65 different enactments during the period between 1275 and 1753 provided for double, treble, or quadruple damages 33 Our decisions in both Haslip and TXO endorsed the proposition that a comparison between the compensatory award and the punitive award is signiﬁcant In Haslip we concluded that even though a punitive damages award of “more than 4 times the amount of compensatory damages” might be “close to the line,” it did not “cross the line into the area of constitutional impropriety ” 499 U S , at 23–24 TXO, following dicta in Haslip, reﬁned this analysis by conﬁrming that the proper inquiry is “ ‘whether there is a reasonable relationship between the punitive damages award and the harm likely to result from the defendant’s conduct as well as the harm that actually has occurred ’ ” TXO, 509 U S , at 460 (emphasis in original), quoting Haslip, 499 U S , at 21 Thus, in upholding the $10 million award in TXO, we relied on the difference between that ﬁgure and the harm to the victim that would have ensued if the tortious plan had succeeded That difference suggested that the relevant ratio was not more than 10 to 1 34 33 Owen, supra n 23, at 368, and n 23 One English statute, for example, provides that ofﬁcers arresting persons out of their jurisdiction shall pay double damages 3 Edw , I , ch 35 Another directs that in an action for forcible entry or detainer, the plaintiff shall recover treble damages 8 Hen VI, ch 9, §6 Present-day federal law allows or mandates imposition of multiple damages for a wide assortment of offenses, including violations of the antitrust laws, see §4 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat 731, as amended, 15 U S C §15, and the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, see 18 U S C §1964, and certain breaches of the trademark laws, see §35 of the Trademark Act of 1946, 60 Stat 439, as amended, 15 U S C §1117, and the patent laws, see 66 Stat 813, 35 U S C §284 34 “While petitioner stresses the shocking disparity between the punitive award and the compensatory award, that shock dissipates when one considers the potential loss to respondents, in terms of reduced or eliminated royalties payments, had petitioner succeeded in its illicit scheme Thus, even if the actual value of the ‘potential harm’ to respondents is not be 582 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Opinion of the Court The $2 million in punitive damages awarded to Dr Gore by the Alabama Supreme Court is 500 times the amount of his actual harm as determined by the jury 35 Moreover, there is no suggestion that Dr Gore or any other BMW purchaser was threatened with any additional potential harm by BMW’s nondisclosure policy The disparity in this case is thus dramatically greater than those considered in Haslip and TXO 36 Of course, we have consistently rejected the notion that the constitutional line is marked by a simple mathematical formula, even one that compares actual and potential damages to the punitive award TXO, 509 U S , at 458 37 Indeed, low awards of compensatory damages may properly support a higher ratio than high compensatory awards, if, for example, a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages A higher ratio may also be justiﬁed in cases in which the injury is hard to detect or the monetary value of noneconomic harm might have been difﬁcult to determine It is appropriate, therefore, to reiterate our rejection of a categorical approach Once again, “we return to what we said  in Haslip ‘We need not, and tween $5 million and $8 3 million, but is closer to $4 million, or $2 million, or even $1 million, the disparity between the punitive award and the potential harm does not, in our view, ‘jar one’s constitutional sensibilities ’ ” TXO, 509 U S , at 462, quoting Haslip, 499 U S , at 18 35 Even assuming each repainted BMW suffers a diminution in value of approximately $4,000, the award is 35 times greater than the total damages of all 14 Alabama consumers who purchased repainted BMW’s 36 The ratio here is also dramatically greater than any award that would be permissible under the statutes and proposed statutes summarized in the appendix to Justice Ginsburg’s dissenting opinion Post, at 615–616 37 Conceivably the Alabama Supreme Court’s selection of a 500-to-1 ratio was an application of Justice Scalia’s identiﬁcation of one possible reading of the plurality opinion in TXO Any future due process challenge to a punitive damages award could be disposed of with the simple observation that “this is no worse than TXO ” 509 U S , at 472 (Scalia, J , concurring in judgment) As we explain in the text, this award is signiﬁcantly worse than the award in TXO 583 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Opinion of the Court indeed we cannot, draw a mathematical bright line between the constitutionally acceptable and the constitutionally unacceptable that would ﬁt every case We can say, however, that [a] general concer[n] of reasonableness  properly enter[s] into the constitutional calculus ’ ” Id , at 458 (quoting Haslip, 499 U S , at 18) In most cases, the ratio will be within a constitutionally acceptable range, and remittitur will not be justiﬁed on this basis When the ratio is a breathtaking 500 to 1, however, the award must surely “raise a suspicious judicial eyebrow ” TXO, 509 U S , at 481 (O’Connor, J , dissenting) Sanctions for Comparable Misconduct Comparing the punitive damages award and the civil or criminal penalties that could be imposed for comparable misconduct provides a third indicium of excessiveness As Justice O’Connor has correctly observed, a reviewing court engaged in determining whether an award of punitive damages is excessive should “accord ‘substantial deference’ to legislative judgments concerning appropriate sanctions for the conduct at issue ” Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt , Inc v Kelco Disposal, Inc , 492 U S , at 301 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part) In Haslip, 499 U S , at 23, the Court noted that although the exemplary award was “much in excess of the ﬁne that could be imposed,” imprisonment was also authorized in the criminal context 38 In this 38 Although the Court did not address the size of the punitive damages award in Silkwood v Kerr-McGee Corp , 464 U S 238 (1984), the dissenters commented on its excessive character, noting that the “$10 million [punitive damages award] that the jury imposed is 100 times greater than the maximum ﬁne that may be imposed  for a single violation of federal standards” and “more than 10 times greater than the largest single ﬁne that the Commission has ever imposed ” Id , at 263 (Blackmun, J , dissenting) In New York Times Co v Sullivan, 376 U S 254 (1964), the Court observed that the punitive award for libel was “one thousand times greater than the maximum ﬁne provided by the Alabama criminal statute,” and concluded that the “fear of damage awards under a rule such as 584 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Opinion of the Court case the $2 million economic sanction imposed on BMW is substantially greater than the statutory ﬁnes available in Alabama and elsewhere for similar malfeasance The maximum civil penalty authorized by the Alabama Legislature for a violation of its Deceptive Trade Practices Act is $2,000 39 other States authorize more severe sanctions, with the maxima ranging from $5,000 to $10,000 40 Signiﬁcantly, some statutes draw a distinction between ﬁrst offenders and recidivists thus, in New York the penalty is $50 for a ﬁrst offense and $250 for subsequent offenses None of these statutes would provide an out-of-state distributor with fair notice that the ﬁrst violation—or, indeed the ﬁrst 14 violations—of its provisions might subject an offender to a multimillion dollar penalty Moreover, at the time BMW’s policy was ﬁrst challenged, there does not appear to have been any judicial decision in Alabama or elsewhere indicating that application of that policy might give rise to such severe punishment The sanction imposed in this case cannot be justiﬁed on the ground that it was necessary to deter future misconduct without considering whether less drastic remedies could be expected to achieve that goal The fact that a multimillion dollar penalty prompted a change in policy sheds no light on the question whether a lesser deterrent would have adequately protected the interests of Alabama consumers In that invoked by the Alabama courts here may be markedly more inhibiting than the fear of prosecution under a criminal statute ” Id , at 277 39 Ala Code §8–19–11(b) (1993) 40 See, e g , Ark Code Ann §23–112–309(b) (1992) (up to $5,000 for violation of state Motor Vehicle Commission Act that would allow suspension of dealer’s license up to $10,000 for violation of Act that would allow revocation of dealer’s license) Fla Stat §320 27(12) (1992) (up to $1,000) Ga Code Ann §§40–1–5(g), 10–1–397(a) (1994 and Supp 1996) (up to $2,000 administratively up to $5,000 in superior court) Ind

for subsequent offenses) 585 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Opinion of the Court the absence of a history of noncompliance with known statutory requirements, there is no basis for assuming that a more modest sanction would not have been sufﬁcient to motivate full compliance with the disclosure requirement imposed by the Alabama Supreme Court in this case IV We assume, as the juries in this case and in the Yates case found, that the undisclosed damage to the new BMW’s affected their actual value Notwithstanding the evidence adduced by BMW in an effort to prove that the repainted cars conformed to the same quality standards as its other cars, we also assume that it knew, or should have known, that as time passed the repainted cars would lose their attractive appearance more rapidly than other BMW’s Moreover, we of course accept the Alabama courts’ view that the state interest in protecting its citizens from deceptive trade practices justiﬁes a sanction in addition to the recovery of compensatory damages We cannot, however, accept the conclusion of the Alabama Supreme Court that BMW’s conduct was sufﬁciently egregious to justify a punitive sanction that is tantamount to a severe criminal penalty The fact that BMW is a large corporation rather than an impecunious individual does not diminish its entitlement to fair notice of the demands that the several States impose on the conduct of its business Indeed, its status as an active participant in the national economy implicates the federal interest in preventing individual States from imposing undue burdens on interstate commerce While each State has ample power to protect its own consumers, none may use the punitive damages deterrent as a means of imposing its regulatory policies on the entire Nation As in Haslip, we are not prepared to draw a bright line marking the limits of a constitutionally acceptable punitive damages award Unlike that case, however, we are fully convinced that the grossly excessive award imposed in this 586 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Breyer, J , concurring case transcends the constitutional limit 41 Whether the appropriate remedy requires a new trial or merely an independent determination by the Alabama Supreme Court of the award necessary to vindicate the economic interests of Alabama consumers is a matter that should be addressed by the state court in the ﬁrst instance The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion It is so ordered Justice Breyer, with whom Justice O’Connor and Justice Souter join, concurring The Alabama state courts have assessed the defendant $2 million in “punitive damages” for having knowingly failed to tell a BMW automobile buyer that, at a cost of $600, it had repainted portions of his new $40,000 car, thereby lowering its potential resale value by about 10% The Court’s opinion, which I join, explains why we have concluded that this award, in this case, was “grossly excessive” in relation to legitimate punitive damages objectives, and hence an arbitrary deprivation of life, liberty, or property in violation of the Due Process Clause See TXO Production Corp v Alliance Resources Corp , 509 U S 443, 453, 454 (1993) (A “grossly excessive” punitive award amounts to an “arbitrary deprivation of property without due process of law”) (plurality opinion) Members of this Court have generally thought, however, that if “fair procedures were followed, a judgment that is a product of that process is entitled to a strong pre41 Justice Ginsburg expresses concern that we are “the only federal court policing” this limit Post, at 613 The small number of punitive damages questions that we have reviewed in recent years, together with the fact that this is the ﬁrst case in decades in which we have found that a punitive damages award exceeds the constitutional limit, indicates that this concern is at best premature In any event, this consideration surely does not justify an abdication of our responsibility to enforce constitutional protections in an extraordinary case such as this one 587 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Breyer, J , concurring sumption of validity ” Id , at 457 See also Paciﬁc Mut Life Ins Co v Haslip, 499 U S 1, 40–42 (1991) (Kennedy, J , concurring in judgment) And the Court also has found that punitive damages procedures very similar to those followed here were not, by themselves, fundamentally unfair Id , at 15–24 Thus, I believe it important to explain why this presumption of validity is overcome in this instance The reason ﬂows from the Court’s emphasis in Haslip upon the constitutional importance of legal standards that provide “reasonable constraints” within which “discretion is exercised,” that assure “meaningful and adequate review by the trial court whenever a jury has ﬁxed the punitive damages,” and permit “appellate review [that] makes certain that the punitive damages are reasonable in their amount and rational in light of their purpose to punish what has occurred and to deter its repetition ” Id , at 20–21 See also id , at 18 (“[U]nlimited jury discretion—or unlimited judicial discretion for that matter—in the ﬁxing of punitive damages may invite extreme results that jar one’s constitutional sensibilities”) This constitutional concern, itself harkening back to the Magna Carta, arises out of the basic unfairness of depriving citizens of life, liberty, or property, through the application, not of law and legal processes, but of arbitrary coercion Daniels v Williams, 474 U S 327, 331 (1986) Dent v West Virginia, 129 U S 114, 123 (1889) Requiring the application of law, rather than a decisionmaker’s caprice, does more than simply provide citizens notice of what actions may subject them to punishment it also helps to assure the uniform general treatment of similarly situated persons that is the essence of law itself See Railway Express Agency, Inc v New York, 336 U S 106, 112 (1949) (Jackson, J , concurring) (“[T]here is no more effective practical guaranty against arbitrary and unreasonable government than to require that the principles of law which ofﬁcials would impose upon a minority must be imposed generally”) 588 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Breyer, J , concurring Legal standards need not be precise in order to satisfy this constitutional concern See Haslip, supra, at 20 (comparing punitive damages standards to such legal standards as “reasonable care,” “due diligence,” and “best interests of the child”) (internal quotation marks omitted) But they must offer some kind of constraint upon a jury or court’s discretion, and thus protection against purely arbitrary behavior The standards the Alabama courts applied here are vague and open ended to the point where they risk arbitrary results In my view, although the vagueness of those standards does not, by itself, violate due process, see Haslip, supra, it does invite the kind of scrutiny the Court has given the particular verdict before us See id , at 18 (“[C]oncerns of  adequate guidance from the court when the case is tried to a jury properly enter into the constitutional calculus”) TXO, supra, at 475 (“[I]t cannot be denied that the lack of clear guidance heightens the risk that arbitrariness, passion, or bias will replace dispassionate deliberation as the basis for the jury’s verdict”) (O’Connor, J , dissenting) This is because the standards, as the Alabama Supreme Court authoritatively interpreted them here, provided no signiﬁcant constraints or protection against arbitrary results First, the Alabama statute that permits punitive damages does not itself contain a standard that readily distinguishes between conduct warranting very small, and conduct warranting very large, punitive damages awards That statute permits punitive damages in cases of “oppression, fraud, wantonness, or malice ” Ala Code §6–11–20(a) (1993) But the statute goes on to deﬁne those terms broadly, to encompass far more than the egregious conduct that those terms, at ﬁrst reading, might seem to imply An intentional misrepresentation, made through a statement or silence, can easily amount to “fraud” sufﬁcient to warrant punitive damages See §6–11–20(b)(1) (“Fraud” includes “intentional  concealment of a material fact the concealing party had a 589 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Breyer, J , concurring duty to disclose, which was gross, oppressive, or malicious and committed with the intention  of thereby depriving a person or entity of property”) (emphasis added) §6–11– 20(b)(2) (“Malice” includes any “wrongful act without just cause or excuse  [w]ith an intent to injure the  property of another”) (emphasis added) §6–11–20(b)(5) (“Oppression” includes “[s]ubjecting a person to  unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights”) The statute thereby authorizes punitive damages for the most serious kinds of misrepresentations, say, tricking the elderly out of their life savings, for much less serious conduct, such as the failure to disclose repainting a car, at issue here, and for a vast range of conduct in between Second, the Alabama courts, in this case, have applied the “factors” intended to constrain punitive damages awards in a way that belies that purpose Green Oil Co v Hornsby, 539 So 2d 218 (Ala 1989), sets forth seven factors that appellate courts use to determine whether or not a jury award was “grossly excessive” and which, in principle, might make up for the lack of signiﬁcant constraint in the statute But, as the Alabama courts have authoritatively interpreted them, and as their application in this case illustrates, they impose little actual constraint (a) Green Oil requires that a punitive damages award “bear a reasonable relationship to the harm that is likely to occur from the defendant’s conduct as well as to the harm that actually has occurred ” Id , at 223 But this standard does little to guide a determination of what counts as a “reasonable” relationship, as this case illustrates The record evidence of past, present, or likely future harm consists of (a) $4,000 of harm to Dr Gore’s BMW (b) 13 other similar Alabama instances and (c) references to about 1,000 similar instances in other States The Alabama Supreme Court, disregarding BMW’s failure to make relevant objection to the out-of-state instances at trial (as was the court’s right), held that the last mentioned, out-of-state instances did not 590 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Breyer, J , concurring count as relevant harm It went on to ﬁnd “a reasonable relationship” between the harm and the $2 million punitive damages award without “consider[ing] those acts that occurred in other jurisdictions ” 646 So 2d 619, 628 (1994) (emphasis added) For reasons explored by the majority in greater depth, see ante, at 574–586, the relationship between this award and the underlying conduct seems well beyond the bounds of the “reasonable ” To ﬁnd a “reasonable relationship” between purely economic harm totaling $56,000, without signiﬁcant evidence of future repetition, and a punitive award of $2 million is to empty the “reasonable relationship” test of meaningful content As thus construed, it does not set forth a legal standard that could have signiﬁcantly constrained the discretion of Alabama factﬁnders (b) Green Oil’s second factor is the “degree of reprehensibility” of the defendant’s conduct Green Oil, supra, at 223 Like the “reasonable relationship” test, this factor provides little guidance on how to relate culpability to the size of an award The Alabama court, in considering this factor, found “reprehensible” that BMW followed a conscious policy of not disclosing repairs to new cars when the cost of repairs amounted to less than 3% of the car’s value Of course, any conscious policy of not disclosing a repair—where one knows the nondisclosure might cost the customer resale value—is “reprehensible” to some degree But, for the reasons discussed by the majority, ante, at 575–580, I do not see how the Alabama courts could ﬁnd conduct that (they assumed) caused $56,000 of relevant economic harm especially or unusually reprehensible enough to warrant $2 million in punitive damages, or a signiﬁcant portion of that award To ﬁnd to the contrary, as the Alabama courts did, is not simply unreasonable it is to make “reprehensibility” a concept without constraining force, i e , to deprive the concept of its constraining power to protect against serious and capricious deprivations 591 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Breyer, J , concurring (c) Green Oil’s third factor requires “punitive damages” to “remove the proﬁt” of the illegal activity and “be in excess of the proﬁt, so that the defendant recognizes a loss ” Green Oil, 539 So 2d, at 223 This factor has the ability to limit awards to a ﬁxed, rational amount But as applied, that concept’s potential was not realized, for the court did not limit the award to anywhere near the $56,000 in proﬁts evidenced in the record Given the record’s description of the conduct and its prevalence, this factor could not justify much of the $2 million award (d) Green Oil’s fourth factor is the “ﬁnancial position” of the defendant Ibid Since a ﬁxed dollar award will punish a poor person more than a wealthy one, one can understand the relevance of this factor to the State’s interest in retribution (though not necessarily to its interest in deterrence, given the more distant relation between a defendant’s wealth and its responses to economic incentives) See TXO, 509 U S , at 462, and n 28 (plurality opinion) id , at 469 (Kennedy, J , concurring in part and concurring in judgment) Haslip, 499 U S , at 21–22 Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt , Inc v Kelco Disposal, Inc , 492 U S 257, 300 (1989) (O’Connor, J , concurring in part and dissenting in part) This factor, however, is not necessarily intended to act as a signiﬁcant constraint on punitive awards Rather, it provides an open-ended basis for inﬂating awards when the defendant is wealthy, as this case may illustrate That does not make its use unlawful or inappropriate it simply means that this factor cannot make up for the failure of other factors, such as “reprehensibility,” to constrain signiﬁcantly an award that purports to punish a defendant’s conduct (e) Green Oil’s ﬁfth factor is the “costs of litigation” and the State’s desire “to encourage plaintiffs to bring wrongdoers to trial ” 539 So 2d, at 223 This standard provides meaningful constraint to the extent that the enhancement it authorized is linked to a ﬁxed, ascertainable amount approximating actual costs, even when deﬁned generously to reﬂect 592 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Breyer, J , concurring the contingent nature of plaintiffs’ victories But as this case shows, the factor cannot operate as a constraint when an award much in excess of costs is approved for other reasons An additional aspect of the standard—the need to “encourage plaintiffs to bring wrongdoers to trial”—is a factor that does not constrain, but enhances, discretionary power—especially when unsupported by evidence of a special need to encourage litigation (which the Alabama courts here did not mention) (f) Green Oil’s sixth factor is whether or not “criminal sanctions have been imposed on the defendant for his conduct ” Ibid This factor did not apply here (g) Green Oil’s seventh factor requires that “other civil actions” ﬁled “against the same defendant, based on the same conduct,” be considered in mitigation Id , at 224 That factor did not apply here Thus, the ﬁrst, second, and third Green Oil factors, in principle, might sometimes act as constraints on arbitrary behavior But as the Alabama courts interpreted those standards in this case, even taking those three factors together, they could not have signiﬁcantly constrained the court system’s ability to impose “grossly excessive” awards Third, the state courts neither referred to, nor made any effort to ﬁnd, nor enunciated any other standard that either directly, or indirectly as background, might have supplied the constraining legal force that the statute and Green Oil standards (as interpreted here) lack Dr Gore did argue to the jury an economic theory based on the need to offset the totality of the harm that the defendant’s conduct caused Some theory of that general kind might have provided a signiﬁcant constraint on arbitrary awards (at least where conﬁned to the relevant harm-causing conduct, see ante, at 570–574) Some economists, for example, have argued for a standard that would deter illegal activity causing solely economic harm through the use of punitive damages awards that, as a whole, would take from a wrongdoer the total cost of the 593 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Breyer, J , concurring harm caused See, e g , S Shavell, Economic Analysis of Accident Law 162 (1987) (“If liability equals losses caused multiplied by  the inverse of the probability of suit, injurers will act optimally under liability rules despite the chance that they will escape suit”) Cooter, Punitive Damages for Deterrence When and How Much, 40 Ala L Rev 1143, 1146–1148 (1989) My understanding of the intuitive essence of some of those theories, which I put in crude form (leaving out various qualiﬁcations), is that they could permit juries to calculate punitive damages by making a rough estimate of global harm, dividing that estimate by a similarly rough estimate of the number of successful lawsuits that would likely be brought, and adding generous attorney’s fees and other costs Smaller damages would not sufﬁciently discourage ﬁrms from engaging in the harmful conduct, while larger damages would “over-deter” by leading potential defendants to spend more to prevent the activity that causes the economic harm, say, through employee training, than the cost of the harm itself See Galligan, Augmented Awards The Efﬁcient Evolution of Punitive Damages, 51 La L Rev 3, 17–20, 28–30 (1990) Larger damages might also “double count” by including in the punitive damages award some of the compensatory, or punitive, damages that subsequent plaintiffs would also recover The record before us, however, contains nothing suggesting that the Alabama Supreme Court, when determining the allowable award, applied any “economic” theory that might explain the $2 million recovery Cf Browning-Ferris, supra, at 300 (noting that the Constitution “does not incorporate the views of the Law and Economics School,” nor does it “ ‘require the States to subscribe to any particular economic theory’ ”) (O’Connor, J , concurring in part and dissenting in part) (quoting CTS Corp v Dynamics Corp of America, 481 U S 69, 92 (1987)) And courts properly tend to judge the rationality of judicial actions in terms of the reasons that were given, and the facts that were before the court, cf TXO, 594 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Breyer, J , concurring 509 U S , at 468 (Kennedy, J , concurring in part and concurring in judgment), not those that might have been given on the basis of some conceivable set of facts (unlike the rationality of economic statutes enacted by legislatures subject to the public’s control through the ballot box, see, e g , FCC v Beach Communications, Inc , 508 U S 307, 315 (1993)) Therefore, reference to a constraining “economic” theory, which might have counseled more deferential review by this Court, is lacking in this case Fourth, I cannot ﬁnd any community understanding or historic practice that this award might exemplify and which, therefore, would provide background standards constraining arbitrary behavior and excessive awards A punitive damages award of $2 million for intentional misrepresentation causing $56,000 of harm is extraordinary by historical standards, and, as far as I am aware, ﬁnds no analogue until relatively recent times Amici for Dr Gore attempt to show that this is not true, pointing to various historical cases which, according to their calculations, represented roughly equivalent punitive awards for similarly culpable conduct See Brief for James D A Boyle et al as Amici Curiae 4–5 (hereinafter Legal Historians’ Brief) Among others, they cite Wilkes v Wood, Lofft 1, 98 Eng Rep 489 (C P 1763) (£1,000 said to be equivalent of $1 5 million, for warrantless search of papers) Huckle v Money, 2 Wills 205, 95 Eng Rep 768 (K B 1763) (£300, said to be $450,000, for 6-hour false imprisonment) Hewlett v Cruchley, 5 Taunt 277, 128 Eng Rep 696 (C P 1813) (£2,000, said to be $680,000, for malicious prosecution) Merest v Harvey, 5 Taunt 442, 128 Eng Rep 761 (C P 1814) (£500, said to be $165,000, for poaching) But amici apparently base their conversions on a mathematical assumption, namely, that inﬂation has progressed at a constant 3% rate of inﬂation See Legal Historians’ Brief 4 In fact, consistent, cumulative inﬂation is a modern phenomenon See McCusker, How Much Is That in Real Money? A Historical Price Index for Use as a Deﬂator 595 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Breyer, J , concurring of Money Values in the Economy of the United States, 101 Proceedings of American Antiquarian Society 297, 310, 323– 332 (1992) Estimates based on historical rates of valuation, while highly approximate, suggest that the ancient extraordinary awards are small compared to the $2 million here at issue, or other modern punitive damages ﬁgures See Appendix to this opinion, infra, at 597–598 (suggesting that the modern equivalent of the awards in the above cases is something like $150,000, $45,000, $100,000, and $25,000, respectively) And, as the majority opinion makes clear, the record contains nothing to suggest that the extraordinary size of the award in this case is explained by the extraordinary wrongfulness of the defendant’s behavior, measured by historical or community standards, rather than arbitrariness or caprice Fifth, there are no other legislative enactments here that classify awards and impose quantitative limits that would signiﬁcantly cabin the fairly unbounded discretion created by the absence of constraining legal standards Cf , e g , Tex Civ Prac Rem Code Ann §41 008 (Supp 1996) (punitive damages generally limited to greater of double damages, or $200,000, except cap does not apply to suits arising from certain serious criminal acts enumerated in the statute) Conn Gen Stat §52–240b (1995) (punitive damages may not exceed double compensatory damages in product liability cases) Fla Stat §768 73(1) (Supp 1993) (punitive damages in certain actions limited to treble compensatory damages) Ga Code Ann §51–12–5 1(g) (Supp 1995) ($250,000 cap in certain actions) The upshot is that the rules that purport to channel discretion in this kind of case, here did not do so in fact That means that the award in this case was both (a) the product of a system of standards that did not signiﬁcantly constrain a court’s, and hence a jury’s, discretion in making that award and (b) grossly excessive in light of the State’s legitimate punitive damages objectives 596 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Breyer, J , concurring The ﬁrst of these reasons has special importance where courts review a jury-determined punitive damages award That is because one cannot expect to direct jurors like legislators through the ballot box nor can one expect those jurors to interpret law like judges, who work within a discipline and hierarchical organization that normally promotes roughly uniform interpretation and application of the law Yet here Alabama expects jurors to act, at least a little, like legislators or judges, for it permits them, to a certain extent, to create public policy and to apply that policy, not to compensate a victim, but to achieve a policy-related objective outside the conﬁnes of the particular case To the extent that neither clear legal principles nor fairly obvious historical or community-based standards (deﬁning, say, especially egregious behavior) signiﬁcantly constrain punitive damages awards, is there not a substantial risk of outcomes so arbitrary that they become difﬁcult to square with the Constitution’s assurance, to every citizen, of the law’s protection? The standards here, as authoritatively interpreted, in my view, make this threat real and not theoretical And, in these unusual circumstances, where legal standards offer virtually no constraint, I believe that this lack of constraining standards warrants this Court’s detailed examination of the award The second reason—the severe disproportionality between the award and the legitimate punitive damages objectives— reﬂects a judgment about a matter of degree I recognize that it is often difﬁcult to determine just when a punitive award exceeds an amount reasonably related to a State’s legitimate interests, or when that excess is so great as to amount to a matter of constitutional concern Yet whatever the difﬁculties of drawing a precise line, once we examine the award in this case, it is not difﬁcult to say that this award lies on the line’s far side The severe lack of proportionality between the size of the award and the underlying punitive damages objectives shows that the award falls into the cate 597 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Appendix to opinion of Breyer, J gory of “gross excessiveness” set forth in this Court’s prior cases These two reasons taken together overcome what would otherwise amount to a “strong presumption of validity ” TXO, 509 U S , at 457 And, for those two reasons, I conclude that the award in this unusual case violates the basic guarantee of nonarbitrary governmental behavior that the Due Process Clause provides APPENDIX TO OPINION OF BREYER, J Although I recognize that all estimates of historic rates of inﬂation are subject to dispute, including, I assume, the sources below, those sources suggest that the value of the 18th and 19th century judgments cited by amici is much less than the ﬁgures amici arrived at under their presumption of a constant 3% rate of inﬂation In 1763, £1 (Eng ) was worth £1 73 Pennsylvania currency See U S Bureau of the Census, Historical Statistics of the United States Colonial Times to 1970, Series Z–585, p 1198 (Bicentennial ed 1975) For the period 1766–1772, £1 (Penn ) was worth $45 99 (U S 1991) See McCusker, How Much Is That in Real Money? A Historical Price Index for Use as a Deﬂator of Money Values in the Economy of the United States, 101 American Antiquarian Society 297, 333 (1992) Thus, £1 (Eng 1763) is worth about $79 56 (U S 1991) Accounting for the 12% inﬂation of the U S dollar between 1991 and 1995 (when amici ﬁled their brief), see Economic Indicators, 104th Cong , 2d Sess , p 23 (Feb 1996), £1 (Eng 1763) is worth about $89 11 (U S 1995) Calculated another way, £1 (Eng 1763) is worth about £72 84 (Eng 1991) See McCusker, supra, at 312, 342, 350 And £1 (Eng 1991) is worth $1 77 (U S 1991) See 78 Fed Reserve Bulletin A68 (Feb 1992) Thus, £1 (Eng 1763) amounts to about $128 93 (U S 1991) Again, accounting for inﬂation between 1991 and 1995, this amounts to about $144 40 (U S 1995) 598 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Scalia, J , dissenting Thus, the above sources suggest that the £1,000 award in Wilkes in 1763 roughly amounts to between $89,110 and $144,440 today, not $1 5 million And the £300 award in Huckle that same year would seem to be worth between $26,733 and $43,320 today, not $450,000 For the period of the Hewlett and Merest decisions, £1 (Eng 1813) is worth about £25 3 (Eng 1991) See McCusker, supra, at 344, 350 Using the 1991 exchange rate, £1 (Eng 1813) is worth about $44 78 (U S 1991) Accounting for inﬂation between 1991 and 1995, this amounts to about $50 16 (U S 1995) Thus, the £2,000 and £500 awards in Hewlett and Merest would seem to be closer to $100,320 and $25,080, respectively, than to amici’s estimates of $680,000 and $165,000 Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins, dissenting Today we see the latest manifestation of this Court’s recent and increasingly insistent “concern about punitive damages that ‘run wild ’ ” Paciﬁc Mut Life Ins Co v Haslip, 499 U S 1, 18 (1991) Since the Constitution does not make that concern any of our business, the Court’s activities in this area are an unjustiﬁed incursion into the province of state governments In earlier cases that were the prelude to this decision, I set forth my view that a state trial procedure that commits the decision whether to impose punitive damages, and the amount, to the discretion of the jury, subject to some judicial review for “reasonableness,” furnishes a defendant with all the process that is “due ” See TXO Production Corp v Alliance Resources Corp , 509 U S 443, 470 (1993) (Scalia, J , concurring in judgment) Haslip, supra, at 25–28 (Scalia, J , concurring in judgment) cf Honda Motor Co v Oberg, 512 U S 415, 435–436 (1994) (Scalia, J , concurring) I do not regard the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause as a secret repository of substantive guarantees against 599 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Scalia, J , dissenting “unfairness”—neither the unfairness of an excessive civil compensatory award, nor the unfairness of an “unreasonable” punitive award What the Fourteenth Amendment’s procedural guarantee assures is an opportunity to contest the reasonableness of a damages judgment in state court but there is no federal guarantee a damages award actually be reasonable See TXO, supra, at 471 (Scalia, J , concurring in judgment) This view, which adheres to the text of the Due Process Clause, has not prevailed in our punitive damages cases See TXO, 509 U S , at 453–462 (plurality opinion) id , at 478– 481 (O’Connor, J , dissenting) Haslip, supra, at 18 When, however, a constitutional doctrine adopted by the Court is not only mistaken but also insusceptible of principled application, I do not feel bound to give it stare decisis effect— indeed, I do not feel justiﬁed in doing so See, e g , Witte v United States, 515 U S 389, 406 (1995) (Scalia, J , concurring in judgment) Walton v Arizona, 497 U S 639, 673 (1990) (Scalia, J , concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) Our punitive damages jurisprudence compels such a response The Constitution provides no warrant for federalizing yet another aspect of our Nation’s legal culture (no matter how much in need of correction it may be), and the application of the Court’s new rule of constitutional law is constrained by no principle other than the Justices’ subjective assessment of the “reasonableness” of the award in relation to the conduct for which it was assessed Because today’s judgment represents the ﬁrst instance of this Court’s invalidation of a state-court punitive assessment as simply unreasonably large, I think it a proper occasion to discuss these points at some length I The most signiﬁcant aspects of today’s decision—the identiﬁcation of a “substantive due process” right against a “grossly excessive” award, and the concomitant assumption 600 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Scalia, J , dissenting of ultimate authority to decide anew a matter of “reasonableness” resolved in lower court proceedings—are of course not new Haslip and TXO revived the notion, moribund since its appearance in the ﬁrst years of this century, that the measure of civil punishment poses a question of constitutional dimension to be answered by this Court Neither of those cases, however, nor any of the precedents upon which they relied, actually took the step of declaring a punitive award unconstitutional simply because it was “too big ” At the time of adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, it was well understood that punitive damages represent the assessment by the jury, as the voice of the community, of the measure of punishment the defendant deserved See, e g , Barry v Edmunds, 116 U S 550, 565 (1886) Missouri Paciﬁc R Co v Humes, 115 U S 512, 521 (1885) Day v Woodworth, 13 How 363, 371 (1852) See generally Haslip, supra, at 25–27 (Scalia, J , concurring in judgment) Today’s decision, though dressed up as a legal opinion, is really no more than a disagreement with the community’s sense of indignation or outrage expressed in the punitive award of the Alabama jury, as reduced by the State Supreme Court It reﬂects not merely, as the concurrence candidly acknowledges, “a judgment about a matter of degree,” ante, at 596 but a judgment about the appropriate degree of indignation or outrage, which is hardly an analytical determination There is no precedential warrant for giving our judgment priority over the judgment of state courts and juries on this matter The only support for the Court’s position is to be found in a handful of errant federal cases, bunched within a few years of one other, which invented the notion that an unfairly severe civil sanction amounts to a violation of constitutional liberties These were the decisions upon which the TXO plurality relied in pronouncing that the Due Process Clause “imposes substantive limits ‘beyond which penalties may not go,’ ” 509 U S , at 454 (quoting Seaboard Air Line R Co v Seegers, 207 U S 73, 78 (1907)) see also 509 U S , 601 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Scalia, J , dissenting at 478–481 (O’Connor, J , dissenting) Haslip, supra, at 18 Although they are our precedents, they are themselves too shallowly rooted to justify the Court’s recent undertaking The only case relied upon in which the Court actually invalidated a civil sanction does not even support constitutional review for excessiveness, since it really concerned the validity, as a matter of procedural due process, of state legislation that imposed a signiﬁcant penalty on a common carrier which lacked the means of determining the legality of its actions before the penalty was imposed See Southwestern Telegraph Telephone Co v Danaher, 238 U S 482, 489–491 (1915) The amount of the penalty was not a subject of independent scrutiny As for the remaining cases, while the opinions do consider arguments that statutory penalties can, by reason of their excessiveness, violate due process, not a single one of these judgments invalidates a damages award See Seaboard, supra, at 78–79 Waters-Pierce Oil Co v Texas (No 1), 212 U S 86, 111–112 (1909) Standard Oil Co of Ind v Missouri, 224 U S 270, 286, 290 (1912) St Louis, I M S R Co v Williams, 251 U S 63, 66–67 (1919) More importantly, this latter group of cases—which again are the sole precedential foundation put forward for the rule of constitutional law espoused by today’s Court—simply fabricated the “substantive due process” right at issue Seaboard assigned no precedent to its bald assertion that the Constitution imposes “limits beyond which penalties may not go,” 207 U S , at 78 Waters-Pierce cited only Coffey v County of Harlan, 204 U S 659 (1907), a case which inquired into the constitutionality of state procedure, id , at 662–663 Standard Oil simply cited Waters-Pierce, and St Louis, I M S R Co offered in addition to these cases only Collins v Johnston, 237 U S 502 (1915), which said nothing to support the notion of a “substantive due process” right against excessive civil penalties, but to the contrary asserted that the prescribing and imposing of criminal punishment were “functions peculiarly belonging to the several States,” 602 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Scalia, J , dissenting id , at 509–510 Thus, the only authority for the Court’s position is simply not authoritative These cases fall far short of what is needed to supplant this country’s longstanding practice regarding exemplary awards, see, e g , Haslip, 499 U S , at 15–18 id , at 25–28 (Scalia, J , concurring in judgment) II One might understand the Court’s eagerness to enter this ﬁeld, rather than leave it with the state legislatures, if it had something useful to say In fact, however, its opinion provides virtually no guidance to legislatures, and to state and federal courts, as to what a “constitutionally proper” level of punitive damages might be We are instructed at the outset of Part II of the Court’s opinion—the beginning of its substantive analysis—that “the federal excessiveness inquiry  begins with an identiﬁcation of the state interests that a punitive award is designed to serve ” Ante, at 568 On ﬁrst reading this, one is faced with the prospect that federal punitive damages law (the new ﬁeld created by today’s decision) will be beset by the sort of “interest analysis” that has laid waste the formerly comprehensible ﬁeld of conﬂict of laws The thought that each assessment of punitive damages, as to each offense, must be examined to determine the precise “state interests” pursued, is most unsettling Moreover, if those “interests” are the most fundamental determinant of an award, one would think that due process would require the assessing jury to be instructed about them It appears, however (and I certainly hope), that all this is a false alarm As Part II of the Court’s opinion unfolds, it turns out to be directed, not to the question “How much punishment is too much?” but rather to the question “Which acts can be punished?” “Alabama does not have the power,” the Court says, “to punish BMW for conduct that was lawful where it occurred and that had no impact on Alabama or its residents ” Ante, at 572–573 That may be true, though 603 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Scalia, J , dissenting only in the narrow sense that a person cannot be held liable to be punished on the basis of a lawful act But if a person has been held subject to punishment because he committed an unlawful act, the degree of his punishment assuredly can be increased on the basis of any other conduct of his that displays his wickedness, unlawful or not Criminal sentences can be computed, we have said, on the basis of “information concerning every aspect of a defendant’s life,” Williams v New York, 337 U S 241, 250–252 (1949) The Court at one point seems to acknowledge this, observing that, although a sentencing court “[cannot] properly punish lawful conduct,” it may in assessing the penalty “consider  lawful conduct that bears on the defendant’s character ” Ante, at 573, n 19 That concession is quite incompatible, however, with the later assertion that, since “neither the jury nor the trial court was presented with evidence that any of BMW’s out-of-state conduct was unlawful,” the Alabama Supreme Court “therefore properly eschewed reliance on BMW’s outof-state conduct,  and based its remitted award solely on conduct that occurred within Alabama ” Ante, at 573–574 Why could the Supreme Court of Alabama not consider lawful (but disreputable) conduct, both inside and outside Alabama, for the purpose of assessing just how bad an actor BMW was? The Court follows up its statement that “Alabama does not have the power  to punish BMW for conduct that was lawful where it occurred” with the statement “Nor may Alabama impose sanctions on BMW in order to deter conduct that is lawful in other jurisdictions ” Ante, at 572–573 The Court provides us no citation of authority to support this proposition—other than the barely analogous cases cited earlier in the opinion, see ante, at 571–572—and I know of none These signiﬁcant issues pronounced upon by the Court are not remotely presented for resolution in the present case There is no basis for believing that Alabama has sought to control conduct elsewhere The statutes at issue merely 604 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Scalia, J , dissenting permit civil juries to treat conduct such as petitioner’s as fraud, and authorize an award of appropriate punitive damages in the event the fraud is found to be “gross, oppressive, or malicious,” Ala Code §6–11–20(b)(1) (1993) To be sure, respondent did invite the jury to consider out-of-state conduct in its calculation of damages, but any increase in the jury’s initial award based on that consideration is not a component of the remitted judgment before us As the Court several times recognizes, in computing the amount of the remitted award the Alabama Supreme Court—whether it was constitutionally required to or not—“expressly disclaimed any reliance on acts that occurred in other jurisdictions ” Ante, at 567 (internal quotation marks omitted) see also ante, at 573–574 Thus, the only question presented by this case is whether that award, limited to petitioner’s Alabama conduct and viewed in light of the factors identiﬁed as properly informing the inquiry, is excessive The Court’s sweeping (and largely unsupported) statements regarding the relationship of punitive awards to lawful or unlawful out-of-state conduct are the purest dicta III In Part III of its opinion, the Court identiﬁes “[t]hree guideposts” that lead it to the conclusion that the award in this case is excessive degree of reprehensibility, ratio between punitive award and plaintiff’s actual harm, and legisla The Alabama Supreme Court said “[W]e must conclude that the award of punitive damages was based in large part on conduct that happened in other jurisdictions  Although evidence of similar acts in other jurisdictions is admissible as to the issue of ‘pattern and practice’ of such acts,  this jury could not use the number of similar acts that a defendant has committed in other jurisdictions as a multiplier when determining the dollar amount of a punitive damages award Such evidence may not be considered in setting the size of the civil penalty, because neither the jury nor the trial court had evidence before it showing in which states the conduct was wrongful ” 646 So 2d 619, 627 (1994) 605 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Scalia, J , dissenting tive sanctions provided for comparable misconduct Ante, at 574–585 The legal signiﬁcance of these “guideposts” is nowhere explored, but their necessary effect is to establish federal standards governing the hitherto exclusively state law of damages Apparently (though it is by no means clear) all three federal “guideposts” can be overridden if “necessary to deter future misconduct,” ante, at 584—a loophole that will encourage state reviewing courts to uphold awards as necessary for the “adequat[e] protect[ion]” of state consumers, ibid By effectively requiring state reviewing courts to concoct rationalizations—whether within the “guideposts” or through the loophole—to justify the intuitive punitive reactions of state juries, the Court accords neither category of institution the respect it deserves Of course it will not be easy for the States to comply with this new federal law of damages, no matter how willing they are to do so In truth, the “guideposts” mark a road to nowhere they provide no real guidance at all As to “degree of reprehensibility” of the defendant’s conduct, we learn that “ ‘nonviolent crimes are less serious than crimes marked by violence or the threat of violence,’ ” ante, at 576 (quoting Solem v Helm, 463 U S 277, 292–293 (1983)), and that “ ‘trickery and deceit’ ” are “more reprehensible than negligence,” ante, at 576 As to the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages, we are told that a “ ‘general concer[n] of reasonableness  enter[s] into the constitutional calculus,’ ” ante, at 583 (quoting TXO, 509 U S , at 458)—though even “a breathtaking 500 to 1” will not necessarily do anything more than “ ‘raise a suspicious judicial eyebrow,’ ” ante, at 583 (quoting TXO, supra, at 481 (O’Connor, J , dissenting), an opinion which, when confronted with that “breathtaking” ratio, approved it) And as to legislative sanctions provided for comparable misconduct, they should be accorded “ ‘substantial deference,’ ” ante, at 583 (quoting Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt , Inc v Kelco Disposal, Inc , 492 U S 257, 301 (1989) (O’Connor, J , concurring in part and dissenting 606 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Scalia, J , dissenting in part)) One expects the Court to conclude “To thine own self be true ” These crisscrossing platitudes yield no real answers in no real cases And it must be noted that the Court nowhere says that these three “guideposts” are the only guideposts indeed, it makes very clear that they are not—explaining away the earlier opinions that do not really follow these “guideposts” on the basis of additional factors, thereby “reiterat[ing] our rejection of a categorical approach ” Ante, at 582 In other words, even these utter platitudes, if they should ever happen to produce an answer, may be overridden by other unnamed considerations The Court has constructed a framework that does not genuinely constrain, that does not inform state legislatures and lower courts—that does nothing at all except confer an artiﬁcial air of doctrinal analysis upon its essentially ad hoc determination that this particular award of punitive damages was not “fair ” The Court distinguishes today’s result from Haslip and TXO partly on the ground that “the record in this case discloses no deliberate false statements, acts of afﬁrmative misconduct, or concealment of evidence of improper motive, such as were present in Haslip and TXO ” Ante, at 579 This seemingly rejects the ﬁndings necessarily made by the jury—that petitioner had committed a fraud that was “gross, oppressive, or malicious,” Ala Code §6–11–20(b)(1) (1993) Perhaps that rejection is intentional the Court does not say The relationship between judicial application of the new “guideposts” and jury ﬁndings poses a real problem for the Court, since as a matter of logic there is no more justiﬁcation for ignoring the jury’s determination as to how reprehensible petitioner’s conduct was (i e , how much it deserves to be punished), than there is for ignoring its determination that it was reprehensible at all (i e , that the wrong was willful and punitive damages are therefore recoverable) That the issue has been framed in terms of a constitutional right against unreasonably excessive awards should not obscure 607 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Ginsburg, J , dissenting the fact that the logical and necessary consequence of the Court’s approach is the recognition of a constitutional right against unreasonably imposed awards as well The elevation of “fairness” in punishment to a principle of “substantive due process” means that every punitive award unreasonably imposed is unconstitutional such an award is by deﬁnition excessive, since it attaches a penalty to conduct undeserving of punishment Indeed, if the Court is correct, it must be that every claim that a state jury’s award of compensatory damages is “unreasonable” (because not supported by the evidence) amounts to an assertion of constitutional injury See TXO, supra, at 471 (Scalia, J , concurring in judgment) And the same would be true for determinations of liability By today’s logic, every dispute as to evidentiary sufﬁciency in a state civil suit poses a question of constitutional moment, subject to review in this Court That is a stupefying proposition For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent Justice Ginsburg, with whom The Chief Justice joins, dissenting The Court, I am convinced, unnecessarily and unwisely ventures into territory traditionally within the States’ domain, and does so in the face of reform measures recently adopted or currently under consideration in legislative arenas The Alabama Supreme Court, in this case, endeavored to follow this Court’s prior instructions and, more recently, Alabama’s highest court has installed further controls on awards of punitive damages (see infra, at 613–614, n 6) I would therefore leave the state court’s judgment undisturbed, and resist unnecessary intrusion into an area dominantly of state concern I The respect due the Alabama Supreme Court requires that we strip from this case a false issue No impermissible “extraterritoriality” infects the judgment before us the exces 608 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Ginsburg, J , dissenting siveness of the award is the sole issue genuinely presented The Court ultimately so recognizes, see ante, at 573–574, but further clariﬁcation is in order Dr Gore’s experience was not unprecedented among customers who bought BMW vehicles sold as ﬂawless and brand-new In addition to his own encounter, Gore showed, through paint repair orders introduced at trial, that on 983 other occasions since 1983, BMW had shipped new vehicles to dealers without disclosing paint repairs costing at least $300, Tr 585–586 at least 14 of the repainted vehicles, the evidence also showed, were sold as new and undamaged to consumers in Alabama 646 So 2d 619, 623 (Ala 1994) Sales nationwide, Alabama’s Supreme Court said, were admissible “as to the issue of a ‘pattern and practice’ of such acts ” Id , at 627 There was “no error,” the court reiterated, “in the admission of the evidence that showed how pervasive the nondisclosure policy was and the intent behind BMW NA’s adoption of it ” Id , at 628 That determination comports with this Court’s expositions See TXO Production Corp v Alliance Resources Corp , 509 U S 443, 462, and n 28 (1993) (characterizing as “well-settled” the admissibility of “evidence of [defendant’s] alleged wrongdoing in other parts of the country” and of defendant’s “wealth”) see also Brief for Petitioner 22 (recognizing that similar acts, out-of-state, traditionally have been considered relevant “for the limited purpose of determining that the conduct before the [c]ourt was reprehensible because it was part of a pattern rather than an isolated incident”) Alabama’s highest court next declared that the “jury could not use the number of similar acts that a defendant has committed in other jurisdictions as a multiplier when determining the dollar amount of a punitive damages award Such evidence may not be considered in setting the size of the civil penalty, because neither the jury nor the trial court had evidence before it showing in which states the conduct was wrong 609 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Ginsburg, J , dissenting ful ” 646 So 2d, at 627 (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted) Because the Alabama Supreme Court provided this clear statement of the State’s law, the multiplier problem encountered in Gore’s case is not likely to occur again Now, as a matter of Alabama law, it is plainly impermissible to assess punitive damages by multiplication based on out-of-state events not shown to be unlawful See, e g , Independent Life and Accident Ins Co v Harrington, 658 So 2d 892, 902–903 (Ala 1994) (under BMW v Gore, trial court erred in relying on defendant insurance company’s out-of-state insurance policies in determining harm caused by defendant’s unlawful actions) No Alabama authority, it bears emphasis—no statute, judicial decision, or trial judge instruction—ever countenanced the jury’s multiplication of the $4,000 diminution in value estimated for each reﬁnished car by the number of such cars (approximately 1,000) shown to have been sold nationwide The sole prompt to the jury to use nationwide sales as a multiplier came from Gore’s lawyer during summation App 31, Tr 812–813 Notably, counsel for BMW failed to object to Gore’s multiplication suggestion, even though BMW’s counsel interrupted to make unrelated objections four other times during Gore’s closing statement Tr 810– 811, 854–855, 858, 870–871 Nor did BMW’s counsel request a charge instructing the jury not to consider out-of-state sales in calculating the punitive damages award See Record 513–529 (listing all charges requested by counsel) Following the verdict, BMW’s counsel challenged the admission of the paint repair orders, but not, alternately, the jury’s apparent use of the orders in a multiplication exercise Curiously, during postverdict argument, BMW’s counsel urged that if the repair orders were indeed admissible, then Gore would have a “full right” to suggest a multiplier-based disgorgement Tr 932 610 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Ginsburg, J , dissenting In brief, Gore’s case is idiosyncratic The jury’s improper multiplication, tardily featured by petitioner, is unlikely to recur in Alabama and does not call for error correction by this Court Because the jury apparently (and erroneously) had used acts in other States as a multiplier to arrive at a $4 million sum for punitive damages, the Alabama Supreme Court itself determined “ ‘the maximum amount that a properly functioning jury could have awarded ’ ” 646 So 2d, at 630 (Houston, J , concurring specially) (quoting Big B, Inc v Cottingham, 634 So 2d 999, 1006 (Ala 1993)) The per curiam opinion emphasized that in arriving at $2 million as “the amount of punitive damages to be awarded in this case, [the court did] not consider those acts that occurred in other jurisdictions ” 646 So 2d, at 628 (emphasis in original) As this Court recognizes, the Alabama high court “properly eschewed reliance on BMW’s out-of-state conduct and based its remitted award solely on conduct that occurred within Alabama ” Ante, at 573–574 (citation omitted) In sum, the Alabama Supreme Court left standing the jury’s decision that the facts warranted an award of punitive damages—a determination not contested in this Court—and the state court concluded that, considering only acts in Alabama, $2 million was “a constitutionally reasonable punitive damages award ” 646 So 2d, at 629 II A Alabama’s Supreme Court reports that it “thoroughly and painstakingly” reviewed the jury’s award, ibid , according to principles set out in its own pathmarking decisions and in this Court’s opinions in TXO and Paciﬁc Mut Life Ins Co v Haslip, 499 U S 1, 21 (1991) 646 So 2d, at 621 The Alabama court said it gave weight to several factors, including BMW’s deliberate (“reprehensible”) presentation of reﬁnished cars as new and undamaged, without disclosing that the value of those cars had been reduced by an estimated 611 Cite as 517 U S 559 (1996) Ginsburg, J , dissenting 10%,1 the ﬁnancial position of the defendant, and the costs of litigation Id , at 625–626 These standards, we previously held, “impos[e] a sufﬁciently deﬁnite and meaningful constraint on the discretion of Alabama factﬁnders in awarding punitive damages ” Haslip, 499 U S , at 22 see also TXO, 509 U S , at 462, n 28 Alabama’s highest court could have displayed its labor pains more visibly,2 but its judgment is nonetheless entitled to a presumption of legitimacy See Rowan v Runnels, 5 How 134, 139 (1847) (“[T]his court will always feel itself bound to respect the decisions of the State courts, and from the time they are made will regard them as conclusive in all cases upon the construction of their own constitution and laws ”) We accept, of course, that Alabama’s Supreme Court applied the State’s own law correctly Under that law, the State’s objectives—“punishment and deterrence”—guide punitive damages awards See Birmingham v Benson, 631 So 2d 902, 904 (Ala 1994) Nor should we be quick to ﬁnd a constitutional inﬁrmity when the highest state court endeavored a corrective for one counsel’s slip and the other’s oversight—counsel for plaintiff’s excess in summation, unobjected to by counsel for defendant, see supra, at 609—and when the state court did so intending to follow the process approved in our Haslip and TXO decisions B The Court ﬁnds Alabama’s $2 million award not simply excessive, but grossly so, and therefore unconstitutional 1 According to trial testimony, in late May 1992, BMW began redirecting reﬁnished cars out of Alabama

160–163 (1987) (economic model for assessing propriety of punitive damages in certain tort cases) 612 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC v GORE Ginsburg, J , dissenting The decision leads us further into territory traditionally within the States’ domain,3 and commits the Court, now and again, to correct “misapplication of a properly stated rule of law ” But cf this Court’s Rule 10 (“A petition for a writ of certiorari is rarely granted when the asserted error consists of erroneous factual ﬁndings or the misapplication of a properly stated rule of law ”) 4 The Court is not well equipped 3 See

particular case ”) Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt , Inc v Kelco Disposal, Inc , 492 U S 257, 278 (1989) (In any “lawsuit where state law provides the basis of decision, the propriety of an award of punitive damages for the conduct in question, and the factors the jury may consider in determining their amount, are questions of state law ”) Silkwood v Kerr-McGee Corp , 464 U S 238, 255 (1984) (“Punitive damages have long been a part of traditional state tort law ”) 4 Petitioner invites the Court to address the question of multiple punitive damages awards stemming from the same alleged misconduct The Court does not take up the invitation, and rightly so, in my judgment, for this case does not present the issue For three reasons, the question of multiple awards is hypothetical, not real, in Gore’s case First, the punitive damages award in favor of Gore is the only such award yet entered against BMW on account of its nondisclosure policy Second, BMW did not raise the issue of multiple punitives below Indeed, in its reply brief before the Alabama Supreme Court, BMW stated “Gore confuses our point about fairness among plaintiffs He treats this point as a premature ‘multiple punitive damages’ argument But, contrary to Gore’s contention, we are not asking this Court to hold, as a matter of law, that a ‘constitutional violation occurs when a defendant is subjected to punitive damages in two separate cases ’ ” Reply Brief for Appellant in Nos 1920324, 1920325 (Ala Sup Ct ), p 48 (internal citations omitted) Third, if BMW had already suffered a punitive damages judgment in connection with its nondisclosure policy, Alabama’s highest court presumably would have taken that fact into consideration In reviewing punitive damages awards attacked as excessive, the Alabama Supreme Court considers whether “there have been other civil actions against the same defendant, based on the same conduct ” 646 So 2d 619, 624 (1994) (quoting Green Oil Co v Hornsby, 539 So

at 582, no “categorical approach,” ibid , no “bright line,” ante, at 585 It has only a vague concept of substantive due process, a “raised eyebrow” test, see ante, at 583, as its ultimate guide 5 In contrast to habeas corpus review under 28 U S C §2254, the Court will work at this business alone It will not be aided by the federal district courts and courts of appeals It will be the only federal court policing the area The Court’s readiness to superintend state-court punitive damages awards is all the more puzzling in view of the Court’s longstanding reluctance to countenance review, even by courts of appeals, of the size of verdicts returned by juries in federal district court proceedings See generally 11 C Wright, A Miller, M Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure §2820 (2d ed 1995) And the reexamination prominent in state courts 6 and in legislative arenas, see Appendix, should be taken into account in mitigation of the punitive damages award ” 646 So 2d, at 624 The Alabama court accordingly observed that Gore’s counsel had ﬁled 24 other actions against BMW in Alabama and Georgia, but that no other punitive damages award had so far resulted Id , at 626 5 Justice Breyer’s concurring opinion offers nothing more solid Under Paciﬁc Mut Life Ins Co v Haslip, 499 U S 1 (1991), he acknowledges, Alabama’s standards for punitive damages, standing alone, do not violate due process Ante, at 588 But they “invit[e] the kind of scrutiny the Court has given the particular verdict before us ” Ibid Pursuing that invitation, Justice Breyer concludes that, matching the particular facts of this case to Alabama’s “legitimate punitive damages objectives,” ante, at 596, the award was “ ‘gross[ly] excessiv[e],’ ” ante, at 597 The exercise is engaging, but ultimately tells us only this too big will be judged unfair What is the Court’s measure of too big? Not a cap of the kind a legislature could order, or a mathematical test this Court can divine and impose Too big is, in the end, the amount at which ﬁve Members of the Court bridle 6 See, e g ,

N H Rev Stat Ann §507 16 (1994) We set out in this appendix some of the several controls enacted or under consideration in the States The measures surveyed are (1) caps on awards (2) provisions for

Henceforth, trials will be bifurcated Initially, juries will be instructed to determine liability and the amount of compensatory damages, if any also, the jury is to return a special verdict on the question whether a punitive damages award is warranted If the jury answers yes to the punitive damages question, the trial will be resumed for the presentation of evidence and instructions relevant to the amount appropriate to award as punitive damages After postverdict trial court review and subsequent appellate review, the amount of the ﬁnal punitive damages judgment will be paid into the trial court The trial court will then order payment of litigation expenses, including the plaintiff’s attorney’s fees, and instruct the clerk to divide the remainder equally between the plaintiff and the

thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular possession or other place under the jurisdiction of the United States, and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefits of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them Provided, That nothing herein contained shall prevent differentials which make only due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale,

investigation and hearing to all interested parties, fix and establish quantity limits, and revise the same as it finds necessary, as to particular commodities or classes of commodities, where it finds that available purchasers in greater quantities are so few as to render differentials on account thereof unjustly discriminatory or promotive of monopoly in any line of commerce and the foregoing shall then not be construed to permit differentials based on differences in quantities greater than those so fixed and established And provided further, That nothing herein contained shall prevent persons engaged in selling goods, wares, or merchandise in commerce from selecting their own customers in bona fide transactions and not in restraint of trade And provided further, That nothing herein contained shall prevent price changes from time to time where in response to changing conditions affecting the market for or the marketability of the goods concerned, such as but not limited to actual or imminent deterioration of perishable goods, obsolescence of seasonal goods, distress sales under court process, or sales in good faith in discontinuance of business in the goods

primafacie case thus made by showing justification shall be upon the person charged with a violation of this section, and unless justification shall be affirmatively shown, the Commission is authorized to issue an order terminating the discrimination Provided, however, That nothing herein contained shall prevent a seller rebutting the prima-facie case thus made by showing that his lower

2012—Decided March 27, 2013 Petitioners, Comcast Corporation and its subsidiaries, allegedly “clus­ ter” their cable television operations within a particular region by swapping their systems outside the region for competitor systems in­ side the region Respondents, named plaintiffs in this class-action antitrust suit, claim that they and other Comcast subscribers in the Philadelphia “cluster” are harmed because Comcast’s strategy lessens competition and leads to supra-competitive prices They sought class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), which requires that “questions of law or fact common to class members pre­ dominate over any questions affecting only individual members ” The District Court required them to show (1) that the “antitrust im­ pact” of the violation could be proved at trial through evidence com­ mon to the class and (2) that the damages were measurable on a classwide basis through a “common methodology ” The court accept­ ed only one of respondents’ four proposed theories of antitrust impact that Comcast’s actions lessened competition from “overbuilders,” i e , companies that build competing networks in areas where an incum­ bent cable company already operates It then certified the class, find­ ing that the damages from overbuilder deterrence could be calculated on a classwide basis, even though respondents’ expert acknowledged that his regression model did not isolate damages resulting from any one of respondents’ theories In affirming, the Third Circuit refused to consider petitioners’ argument that the model failed to attribute damages to overbuilder deterrence because doing so would require reaching the merits of respondents’ claims at the class certification stage Held Respondents’ class action was improperly certified under Rule 23(b)(3) Pp 5–11                     2 COMCAST CORP v BEHREND Syllabus (a) A party seeking to maintain a class action must be prepared to show that Rule 23(a)’s numerosity, commonality, typicality, and ade­ quacy-of-representation requirements have been met, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc v Dukes, 564 U S  , , and must satisfy through ev­ identiary proof at least one of Rule 23(b)’s provisions The same ana­ lytical principles govern certification under both Rule 23(a) and Rule 23(b) Courts may have to “ ‘probe behind the pleadings before com­ ing to rest on the certification question,’ and [a] certification is proper only if ‘the trial court is satisfied, after a rigorous analysis, that [Rule 23’s] prerequisites  have been satisfied ’ ” Ibid The analysis

bore on the propriety of class certification simply because they would also be pertinent to the merits determination If they prevail, respondents would be entitled only to damages resulting from re­ duced overbuilder competition A model that does not attempt to measure only those damages attributable to that theory cannot estab­ lish that damages are susceptible of measurement across the entire

CORPORATION, ET AL , PETITIONERS v CAROLINE BEHREND ET AL ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT [March 27, 2013] JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court The District Court and the Court of Appeals approved certification of a class of more than 2 million current and former Comcast subscribers who seek damages for al- leged violations of the federal antitrust laws We consider whether certification was appropriate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) I Comcast Corporation and its subsidiaries, petitioners here, provide cable-television services to residential and commercial customers From 1998 to 2007, petitioners engaged in a series of transactions that the parties have described as “clustering,” a strategy of concentrating op- erations within a particular region The region at issue here, which the parties have referred to as the Philadelphia “cluster” or the Philadelphia “Designated Market Area” (DMA), includes 16 counties located in Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey 1 Petitioners pursued their —————— 1A “Designated Market Area” is a term used by Nielsen Media Re­ search to define a broadcast-television market Strictly speaking, the         2 COMCAST CORP v BEHREND Opinion of the Court clustering strategy by acquiring competitor cable provid­ ers in the region and swapping their own systems outside the region for competitor systems located in the region For instance, in 2001, petitioners obtained Adelphia Com- munications’ cable systems in the Philadelphia DMA, along with its 464,000 subscribers in exchange, petition­ ers sold to Adelphia their systems in Palm Beach, Florida, and Los Angeles, California As a result of nine clustering transactions, petitioners’ share of subscribers in the re- gion allegedly increased from 23 9 percent in 1998 to 69 5 percent in 2007 See 264 F R D 150, 156, n 8, 160 (ED Pa 2010) The named plaintiffs, respondents here, are subscribers to Comcast’s cable-television services They filed a class­ action antitrust suit against petitioners, claiming that petitioners entered into unlawful swap agreements, in violation of §1 of the Sherman Act, and monopolized or at- tempted to monopolize services in the cluster, in viola­ tion of §2 Ch 647, 26 Stat 209, as amended, 15 U S C §§1, 2 Petitioners’ clustering scheme, respondents con­ tended, harmed subscribers in the Philadelphia cluster by eliminating competition and holding prices for cable ser­ vices above competitive levels Respondents sought to certify a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) That provision permits certification only if “the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members ” The District Court held, and it is uncontested here, that to meet the predominance requirement respondents had to show (1) that the existence of individual injury resulting from the alleged antitrust violation (referred to as “anti­ trust impact”) was “capable of proof at trial through evidence that [was] common to the class rather than indi­ —————— Philadelphia DMA comprises 18 counties, not 16               3 Cite as 569 U S  (2013) Opinion of the Court vidual to its members” and (2) that the damages resulting from that injury were measurable “on a class-wide basis” through use of a “common methodology ” 264 F R D , at 154 2 Respondents proposed four theories of antitrust impact First, Comcast’s clustering made it profitable for Comcast to withhold local sports programming from its competi­ tors, resulting in decreased market penetration by direct broadcast satellite providers Second, Comcast’s activities reduced the level of competition from “overbuilders,” com­ panies that build competing cable networks in areas where an incumbent cable company already operates Third, Comcast reduced the level of “benchmark” competi­ tion on which cable customers rely to compare prices Fourth, clustering increased Comcast’s bargaining power relative to content providers Each of these forms of im­ pact, respondents alleged, increased cable subscription rates throughout the Philadelphia DMA The District Court accepted the overbuilder theory of antitrust impact as capable of classwide proof and rejected the rest Id , at 165, 174, 178, 181 Accordingly, in its certification order, the District Court limited respondents’ “proof of antitrust impact” to “the theory that Comcast engaged in anticompetitive clustering conduct, the effect of which was to deter the entry of overbuilders in the Phila­ delphia DMA ” App to Pet for Cert 192a–193a 3 —————— 2Respondents sought certification for the following class “All cable television customers who subscribe or subscribed at any times since December 1, 1999, to the present to video programming services (other than solely to basic cable services) from Comcast, or any of its subsidi­ aries or affiliates in Comcast’s Philadelphia cluster ” App 35a 3The District Court did not hold that the three alternative theories of liability failed to establish antitrust impact, but merely that those theories could not be determined in a manner common to all the class plaintiffs The other theories of liability may well be available for the plaintiffs to pursue as individual actions Any contention that the plaintiffs should be allowed to recover damages attributable to all four           4 COMCAST CORP v BEHREND Opinion of the Court The District Court further found that the damages resulting from overbuilder-deterrence impact could be calculated on a classwide basis To establish such dam- ages, respondents had relied solely on the testimony of Dr James McClave Dr McClave designed a regression model comparing actual cable prices in the Philadelphia DMA with hypothetical prices that would have prevailed but for petitioners’ allegedly anticompetitive activities The model calculated damages of $875,576,662 for the entire class App 1388a (sealed) As Dr McClave acknowledged, however, the model did not isolate damages resulting from any one theory of antitrust impact Id , at 189a– 190a The District Court nevertheless certified the class A divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed On appeal, petitioners contended the class was improperly certified because the model, among other shortcomings, failed to attribute damages resulting from overbuilder deterrence, the only theory of injury remaining in the case The court refused to consider the argument because, in its view, such an “attac[k] on the merits of the methodology [had] no place in the class certification inquiry ” 655 F 3d 182, 207 (CA3 2011) The court emphasized that, “[a]t the class certification stage,” respondents were not required to “tie each theory of antitrust impact to an exact calcula­ tion of damages ” Id , at 206 According to the court, it had “not reached the stage of determining on the merits whether the methodology is a just and reasonable infer­ ence or speculative ” Ibid Rather, the court said, re­ spondents must “assure us that if they can prove antitrust impact, the resulting damages are capable of measure­ ment and will not require labyrinthine individual calcula­ —————— theories in this class action would erroneously suggest one of two things—either that the plaintiffs may also recover such damages in individual actions or that they are precluded from asserting those theories in individual actions               5 Cite as 569 U S  (2013) Opinion of the Court tions ” Ibid In the court’s view, that burden was met because respondents’ model calculated “supra-competitive prices regardless of the type of anticompetitive conduct ” Id , at 205 We granted certiorari 567 U S  (2012) 4 II The class action is “an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only ” Califano v Yamasaki, 442 U S 682, 700–701 (1979) To come within the exception, a party seeking to maintain a class action “must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance” with Rule 23 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc v Dukes, 564 U S  ,  (2011) (slip op , at 10) The Rule “does not set forth a mere pleading stand­ ard ” Ibid Rather, a party must not only “be prepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law or fact,” typicality of claims or defenses, and adequacy of representation, as required by Rule 23(a) Ibid The party must also satisfy through evidentiary proof at least one of the provisions of Rule —————— 4The question presented reads “Whether a district court may certify a class action without resolving whether the plaintiff class had intro­ duced admissible evidence, including expert testimony, to show that the case is susceptible to awarding damages on a class-wide basis ” 567 U S , at  Respondents contend that petitioners forfeited their ability to answer this question in the negative because they did not make an objection to the admission of Dr McClave’s testimony under the Federal Rules of Evidence See Daubert v Merrell Dow Pharma­ ceuticals, Inc , 509 U S 579 (1993) Such a forfeit would make it impossible for petitioners to argue that Dr McClave’s testimony was not “admissible evidence” under the Rules but it does not make it impossible for them to argue that the evidence failed “to show that the case is susceptible to awarding damages on a class-wide basis ” Peti­ tioners argued below, and continue to argue here, that certification was improper because respondents had failed to establish that damages could be measured on a classwide basis That is the question we address here                6 COMCAST CORP v BEHREND Opinion of the Court 23(b) The provision at issue here is Rule 23(b)(3), which requires a court to find that “the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members ” Repeatedly, we have emphasized that it “‘may be neces­ sary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question,’ and that certification is proper only if ‘the trial court is satisfied, after a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been satisfied ’” Ibid (quoting General Tele­ phone Co of Southwest v Falcon, 457 U S 147, 160–161 (1982)) Such an analysis will frequently entail “overlap with the merits of the plaintiff ’s underlying claim ” 564 U S , at  (slip op , at 10) That is so because the “‘class determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff ’s cause of action ’” Ibid (quoting Falcon, supra, at 160) The same analytical principles govern Rule 23(b) If anything, Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance criterion is even more demanding than Rule 23(a) Amchem Products, Inc v Windsor, 521 U S 591, 623–624 (1997) Rule 23(b)(3), as an “‘adventuresome innovation,’” is designed for situa­ tions “‘in which “class-action treatment is not as clearly called for ”’” Wal-Mart, supra, at  (slip op , at 22) (quoting Amchem, 521 U S , at 614–615) That explains Congress’s addition of procedural safeguards for (b)(3) class members beyond those provided for (b)(1) or (b)(2) class members (e g , an opportunity to opt out), and the court’s duty to take a “‘close look’” at whether common questions predominate over individual ones Id , at 615 III Respondents’ class action was improperly certified un­ der Rule 23(b)(3) By refusing to entertain arguments against respondents’ damages model that bore on the           7 Cite as 569 U S  (2013) Opinion of the Court propriety of class certification, simply because those ar­ guments would also be pertinent to the merits determina­ tion, the Court of Appeals ran afoul of our precedents requiring precisely that inquiry And it is clear that, under the proper standard for evaluating certification, respondents’ model falls far short of establishing that damages are capable of measurement on a classwide basis Without presenting another methodology, respondents cannot show Rule 23(b)(3) predominance Questions of individual damage calculations will inevitably overwhelm questions common to the class This case thus turns on the straightforward application of class-certification prin­ ciples it provides no occasion for the dissent’s extended discussion, post, at 5–11 (GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ , dissenting), of substantive antitrust law A We start with an unremarkable premise If respondents prevail on their claims, they would be entitled only to damages resulting from reduced overbuilder competition, since that is the only theory of antitrust impact accepted for class-action treatment by the District Court It follows that a model purporting to serve as evidence of damages in this class action must measure only those damages at­ tributable to that theory If the model does not even at­ tempt to do that, it cannot possibly establish that damages are susceptible of measurement across the entire class for purposes of Rule 23(b)(3) Calculations need not be exact, see Story Parchment Co v Paterson Parchment Paper Co , 282 U S 555, 563 (1931), but at the class-certification stage (as at trial), any model supporting a “plaintiff ’s damages case must be consistent with its liability case, particularly with respect to the alleged anticompetitive effect of the violation ” ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Proving Antitrust Damages Legal and Economic Issues 57, 62 (2d ed 2010)

analysis’” to determine whether that is so Wal-Mart, supra, at  (slip op , at 10) The District Court and the Court of Appeals saw no need for respondents to “tie each theory of antitrust im­ pact” to a calculation of damages 655 F 3d, at 206 That, they said, would involve consideration of the “merits” having “no place in the class certification inquiry ” Id , at 206–207 That reasoning flatly contradicts our cases requiring a determination that Rule 23 is satisfied, even when that requires inquiry into the merits of the claim Wal-Mart, supra, at , and n 6 (slip op , at 10–11, and n 6) The Court of Appeals simply concluded that re­ spondents “provided a method to measure and quantify damages on a classwide basis,” finding it unnecessary to decide “whether the methodology [was] a just and reason­ able inference or speculative ” 655 F 3d, at 206 Under that logic, at the class-certification stage any method of measurement is acceptable so long as it can be applied classwide, no matter how arbitrary the measurements may be Such a proposition would reduce Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance requirement to a nullity B There is no question that the model failed to measure damages resulting from the particular antitrust injury on which petitioners’ liability in this action is premised 5 —————— 5The dissent is of the view that what an econometric model proves is a “question of fact” on which we will not “undertake to review concur­ rent findings  by two courts below in the absence of a very obvious and exceptional showing of error ” Post, at 9 (quoting United States v Virginia, 518 U S 515, 589, n 5 (1996) (SCALIA, J , dissenting) (inter­ nal quotation marks omitted)) To begin with, neither of the courts below found that the model established damages attributable to over­ building alone Second, while the data contained within an econometric model may well be “questions of fact” in the relevant sense, what those          9 Cite as 569 U S  (2013) Opinion of the Court The scheme devised by respondents’ expert, Dr McClave, sought to establish a “but for” baseline—a figure that would show what the competitive prices would have been if there had been no antitrust violations Damages would then be determined by comparing to that baseline what the actual prices were during the charged period The “but for” figure was calculated, however, by assuming a market that contained none of the four distortions that respondents attributed to petitioners’ actions In other words, the model assumed the validity of all four theories of antitrust impact initially advanced by respondents decreased penetration by satellite providers, overbuilder deterrence, lack of benchmark competition, and increased bargaining power At the evidentiary hearing, Dr McClave expressly admitted that the model calculated damages resulting from “the alleged anticompetitive conduct as a whole” and did not attribute damages to any one particular theory of anticompetitive impact App 189a–190a, 208a  This methodology might have been sound, and might have produced commonality of damages, if all four of those alleged distortions remained in the case But as Judge Jordan’s partial dissent pointed out “[B]ecause the only surviving theory of antitrust im­ pact is that clustering reduced overbuilding, for Dr McClave’s comparison to be relevant, his benchmark counties must reflect the conditions that would have prevailed in the Philadelphia DMA but for the alleged reduction in overbuilding In all respects unrelated to reduced overbuilding, the benchmark counties should

overbuilding alone would be “obvious[ly] and exceptional[ly]” erroneous          10 COMCAST CORP v BEHREND Opinion of the Court reflect the actual conditions in the Philadelphia DMA, or else the model will identify ‘damages’ that are not the result of reduced overbuilding, or, in other words, that are not the certain result of the wrong ” 655 F 3d, at 216 (internal quotation marks omitted) The majority’s only response to this was that “[a]t the class certification stage we do not require that Plaintiffs tie each theory of antitrust impact to an exact calculation of damages, but instead that they assure us that if they can prove antitrust impact, the resulting damages are capable of measurement and will not require labyrinthine individual calculations ” Id , at 206 But such assurance is not provided by a methodology that identifies damages that are not the result of the wrong For all we know, cable subscribers in Gloucester County may have been overcharged because of petitioners’ alleged elimination of satellite competition (a theory of liability that is not ca- pable of classwide proof ) while subscribers in Camden County may have paid elevated prices because of petitioners’ increased bargaining power vis-à-vis content providers (another theory that is not capable of classwide proof ) while yet other subscribers in Montgomery County may have paid rates produced by the combined effects of multi­ ple forms of alleged antitrust harm and so on The per­ mutations involving four theories of liability and 2 million subscribers located in 16 counties are nearly endless In light of the model’s inability to bridge the differences between supra-competitive prices in general and supra­ competitive prices attributable to the deterrence of over­ building, Rule 23(b)(3) cannot authorize treating subscrib­ ers within the Philadelphia cluster as members of a single class 6 Prices whose level above what an expert deems —————— 6We might add that even if the model had identified subscribers who paid more solely because of the deterrence of overbuilding, it still would not have established the requisite commonality of damages unless it        11 Cite as 569 U S

ET AL ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT [March 27, 2013] JUSTICE GINSBURG and JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR and JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting Today the Court reaches out to decide a case hardly fit for our consideration On both procedural and substantive grounds, we dissent I This case comes to the Court infected by our misguided reformulation of the question presented For that reason alone, we would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvi­ dently granted Comcast sought review of the following question “[W]hether a district court may certify a class action with­ out resolving ‘merits arguments’ that bear on [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 23’s prerequisites for certifica­ tion, including whether purportedly common issues pre­ dominate over individual ones under Rule 23(b)(3) ” Pet for Cert i We granted review of a different question “Whether a district court may certify a class action with­ out resolving whether the plaintiff class has introduced admissible evidence, including expert testimony, to show that the case is susceptible to awarding damages on a class-wide basis ” 567 U S  (2012) (emphasis added) Our rephrasing shifted the focus of the dispute from the District Court’s Rule 23(b)(3) analysis to its attention (or             2 COMCAST CORP v BEHREND GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ , dissenting lack thereof) to the admissibility of expert testimony The parties, responsively, devoted much of their briefing to the question whether the standards for admissibility of expert evidence set out in Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and Daubert v Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc , 509 U S 579 (1993), apply in class certification proceedings See Brief for Petitioners 35–49 Brief for Respondents 24–37 Indeed, respondents confirmed at oral argument that they understood our rewritten question to center on admissibil­ ity, not Rule 23(b)(3) See, e g , Tr of Oral Arg 25 As it turns out, our reformulated question was inapt To preserve a claim of error in the admission of evidence, a party must timely object to or move to strike the evidence Fed Rule Evid 103(a)(1) In the months preceding the District Court’s class certification order, Comcast did not object to the admission of Dr McClave’s damages model under Rule 702 or Daubert Nor did Comcast move to strike his testimony and expert report Consequently, Comcast forfeited any objection to the admission of Dr McClave’s model at the certification stage At this late date, Comcast may no longer argue that respondents’ damages evidence was inadmissible Comcast’s forfeiture of the question on which we granted review is reason enough to dismiss the writ as improvi­ dently granted See Rogers v United States, 522 U S 252, 259 (1998) (O’Connor, J , concurring in result) (“[W]e ought not to decide the question if it has not been cleanly presented ”) The Monrosa v Carbon Black Export, Inc , 359 U S 180, 183 (1959) (dismissal appropriate in light of “circumstances  not fully apprehended at the time certiorari was granted” (internal quotation marks omit­ ted)) The Court, however, elects to evaluate whether re­ spondents “failed to show that the case is susceptible to awarding damages on a class-wide basis ” Ante, at 5, n 4 (internal quotation marks omitted) To justify this second revision of the question presented, the Court observes that                 3 Cite as 569 U S  (2013) GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ , dissenting Comcast “argued below, and continue[s] to argue here, that certification was improper because respondents had failed to establish that damages could be measured on a classwide basis ” Ibid And so Comcast did, in addition to endeavoring to address the question on which we granted review By treating the first part of our reformulated question as though it did not exist, the Court is hardly fair to respondents Abandoning the question we instructed the parties to brief does “not reflect well on the processes of the Court ” Redrup v New York, 386 U S 767, 772 (1967) (Harlan, J , dissenting) Taking their cue from our order, respondents did not train their energies on defending the District Court’s finding of predominance in their briefing or at oral argument The Court’s newly revised question, focused on predominance, phrased only after briefing was done, left respondents without an unclouded opportunity to air the issue the Court today decides against them And by re­ solving a complex and fact-intensive question without the benefit of full briefing, the Court invites the error into which it has fallen See infra, at 5–11 II While the Court’s decision to review the merits of the District Court’s certification order is both unwise and un­ fair to respondents, the opinion breaks no new ground on the standard for certifying a class action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) In particular, the deci­ sion should not be read to require, as a prerequisite to certification, that damages attributable to a classwide injury be measurable “‘on a class-wide basis ’” See ante, at 2–3 (acknowledging Court’s dependence on the absence of contest on the matter in this case) Tr of Oral Arg 41 To gain class-action certification under Rule 23(b)(3), the named plaintiff must demonstrate, and the District Court must find, “that the questions of law or fact common              4 COMCAST CORP v BEHREND GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ , dissenting to class members predominate over any questions affect­ ing only individual members ” This predominance re­ quirement is meant to “tes[t] whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by represen­ tation,” Amchem Products, Inc v Windsor, 521 U S 591, 623 (1997), but it scarcely demands commonality as to all questions See 7AA C Wright, A Miller, M Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure §1778, p 121 (3d ed 2005) (hereinafter Wright, Miller, Kane) In particular, when adjudication of questions of

1966 Notes on Fed Rule Civ Proc 23, 28 U S C App , p 141 (“[A] fraud perpetrated on numerous persons by the use of similar misrepresentations may be an appealing situation for a class action, and it

discussion is necessary Plaintiffs below, re­ spondents here, alleged that Comcast violated §§1 and 2 of the Sherman Act See 15 U S C §§1, 2 For present purposes, the §2 claim provides the better illustration A firm is guilty of monopolization under §2 if the plaintiff proves (1) “the possession of monopoly power in the rele­ vant market” and (2) “the willful acquisition or mainte­ nance of that power[,] as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, busi­ ness acumen, or historic accident ” United States v Grinnell Corp , 384 U S 563, 570–571 (1966) A private plaintiff seeking damages must also show that (3) the monopolization caused “injur[y] ” 15 U S C §15 We have said that antitrust injuries must be “of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flo[w] from that which makes defendants’ acts unlawful ” Atlan­ tic Richfield Co v USA Petroleum Co , 495 U S 328, 334 (1990) (quoting Brunswick Corp v Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc , 429 U S 477, 489 (1977)) See 2A Areeda Ho­ venkamp ¶391a, at 320 (To prove antitrust injury, “[a] private plaintiff must identify the economic rationale for a business practice’s illegality under the antitrust laws and show that its harm flows from whatever it is that makes the practice unlawful ”) As plaintiffs below, respondents attempted to meet these requirements by showing that (1) Comcast obtained a 60% or greater share of the Philadelphia market, and that its share provides it with monopoly power (2) Com­ cast acquired its share through exclusionary conduct consisting of a series of mergers with competitors and “swaps” of customers and locations and (3) Comcast con­ sequently injured respondents by charging them supra­ competitive prices If, as respondents contend, Philadelphia is a separate             7 Cite as 569 U S  (2013) GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ , dissenting well-defined market, and the alleged exclusionary conduct permitted Comcast to obtain a market share of at least 60%, then proving the §2 violation may not be arduous As a point of comparison, the government considers a market shared by four firms, each of which has 25% mar­ ket share, to be “highly concentrated ” Dept of Justice Federal Trade Commission, Horizontal Merger Guidelines §5 3, p 19 (2010) A market, such as the one alleged by respondents, where one firm controls 60% is far worse See id , §5 3, at 18–19, and n 9 (using a concentration index that determines a market’s concentration level by summing the squares of each firm’s market share, one firm with 100% yielding 10,000, five firms with 20% each yielding 2000, while a market where one firm accounts for 60% yields an index number of at least 3,600) The Guide­ lines, and any standard antitrust treatise, explain why firms in highly concentrated markets normally have the power to raise prices significantly above competitive lev­ els See, e g , 2B Areeda Hovenkamp ¶503, at 115 B So far there is agreement But consider the last matter respondents must prove Can they show that Comcast injured them by charging higher prices? After all, a firm with monopoly power will not necessarily exercise that power by charging higher prices It could instead act less competitively in other ways, such as by leading the quiet life See J Hicks, Annual Survey of Economic Theory The Theory of Monopoly, 3 Econometrica 1, 8 (1935) (“The best of all monopoly profits is a quiet life ”) It is at this point that Dr McClave’s model enters the scene His model first selects a group of comparable outside-Philadelphia “benchmark” counties, where Comcast enjoyed a lower market share (and where satellite broad­ casting accounted for more of the local business) Using multiple regression analysis, McClave’s model measures            8 COMCAST CORP v BEHREND GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ , dissenting the effect of the anticompetitive conduct by comparing the class counties to the benchmark counties The model concludes that the prices Philadelphia area consumers would have paid had the Philadelphia counties shared the properties of the benchmark counties (including a diminished Comcast market share), would have been 13 1% lower than those they actually paid Thus, the model provides evidence that Comcast’s anticompetitive conduct, which led to a 60% market share, caused the class to suffer injuriously higher prices C 1 The special antitrust-related difficulty present here stems from the manner in which respondents attempted to prove their antitrust injuries They proffered four “non-exclusive mechanisms” that allegedly “cause[d] the high prices” in the Philadelphia area App 403a Those four theories posit that (1) due to Comcast’s acquisitions of competitors, customers found it more difficult to compare prices (2) one set of potential competitors, namely Direct Broadcast Satellite companies, found it more difficult to obtain access to local sports broadcasts and consequently decided not to enter the Philadelphia market (3) Com­ cast’s ability to obtain programming material at lower prices permitted it to raise prices and (4) a number of potential competitors (called “overbuilders”), whose pres­ ence in the market would have limited Comcast’s power to raise prices, were ready to enter some parts of the market but decided not to do so in light of Comcast’s anticompeti­ tive conduct 264 F R D 150, 161–162 (ED Pa 2010) For reasons not here relevant, the District Court found the first three theories inapplicable and limited the liability-phase proof to the “overbuilder” theory See App to Pet for Cert 192a–193a It then asked the parties to brief whether doing so had any impact on the viability of               9 Cite as 569 U S  (2013) GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ , dissenting McClave’s model as a measure of classwide damages See 264 F R D , at 190 After considering the parties’ argu­ ments, the District Court found that striking the three theories “does not impeach Dr McClave’s damages model” because “[a]ny anticompetitive conduct is reflected in the [higher Philadelphia] price [which Dr McClave’s model determines], not in the [the model’s] selection of the comparison counties, [i e , the lower-price ‘benchmark counties’ with which the Philadelphia area prices were compared] ” Id , at 190–191 The court explained that “whether or not we accepted all [four]  theories  is inapposite to Dr McClave’s methods of choosing bench­ marks ” Ibid On appeal, the Third Circuit held that this finding was not an abuse of discretion 655 F 3d 182, 207 (2011) 2 The Court, however, concludes that “the model failed to measure damages resulting from the particular antitrust injury on which petitioners’ liability in this action is prem­ ised ” Ante, at 8 To reach this conclusion the Court must consider fact-based matters, namely what this econometric multiple-regression model is about, what it proves, and how it does so And it must overturn two lower courts’ related factual findings to the contrary We are normally “reluctant to disturb findings of fact in which two courts below have concurred ” United States v Doe, 465 U S 605, 614 (1984) See also United States v Virginia, 518 U S 515, 589, n 5 (1996) (SCALIA, J , dis­ senting) (noting “our well-settled rule that we will not ‘undertake to review concurrent findings of fact by two courts below in the absence of a very obvious and excep­ tional showing of error’” (quoting Graver Tank Mfg Co v Linde Air Products Co , 336 U S 271, 275 (1949))) Here, the District Court found McClave’s econometric model capable of measuring damages on a classwide basis,            10 COMCAST CORP v BEHREND GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ , dissenting even after striking three of the injury theories 264 F R D , at 190–191 Contrary to the Court’s characteriza­ tion, see ante, at 8–9, n 5, this was not a legal conclusion about what the model proved it was a factual finding about how the model worked Under our typical practice, we should leave that finding alone In any event, as far as we can tell, the lower courts were right On the basis of the record as we understand it, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that McClave’s model could measure damages suffered by the class—even if the damages were limited to those caused by deterred overbuilding That is because respondents al­ leged that Comcast’s anticompetitive conduct increased Comcast’s market share (and market power) by deterring potential entrants, in particular, overbuilders, from enter­ ing the Philadelphia area market See App 43a–66a By showing that this was so, respondents’ proof tends to show the same in respect to other entrants The overbuilders’ failure to enter deprives the market of the price discipline that their entry would have provided in other parts via threat of the overbuilders’ expansion or that of others potentially led on by their example Indeed, in the District Court, Comcast argued that the three other theories, i e , the three rejected theories, had no impact on prices See 264 F R D , at 166, 176, 180–181 If Comcast was right, then the damages McClave’s model found must have stemmed exclusively from conduct that deterred new entry, say from “overbuilders ” Not surprisingly, the Court offers no support at all for its contrary conclusion, namely, that the District Court’s finding was “ ‘obvious[ly] and exceptional[ly]’ erroneous ” Ante, at 8–9, n 5 (quoting Virginia, 518 U S , at 589, n 5 (SCALIA, J , dissenting)) We are particularly concerned about the matter because the Court, in reaching its contrary conclusion, makes broad statements about antitrust law that it could not mean to apply in other cases The Court begins with what              11 Cite as 569 U S  (2013) GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ , dissenting it calls an “unremarkable premise” that respondents could be “entitled only to damages resulting from reduced over­ builder competition ” Ante, at 7 In most §2 cases, how­ ever, the Court’s starting place would seem remarkable, not “unremarkable ” Suppose in a different case a plaintiff were to prove that Widget, Inc has obtained, through anticompetitive means, a 90% share of the California widget market Suppose the plaintiff also proves that the two small remaining firms— one in Ukiah, the other in San Diego—lack the capacity to expand their widget output to the point where that pos­ sibility could deter Widget, Inc from raising its prices Suppose further that the plaintiff introduces a model that shows California widget prices are now twice those in every other State, which, the model concludes is (after accounting for other possible reasons) the result of lack of competition in the California widget market Why would a court hearing that case restrict damages solely to custom­ ers in the vicinity of Ukiah and San Diego? Like the model in this example, Dr McClave’s model does not purport to show precisely how Comcast’s conduct led to higher prices in the Philadelphia area It simply shows that Comcast’s conduct brought about higher prices And it measures the amount of subsequent harm   Because the parties did not fully argue the question the Court now answers, all Members of the Court may lack a complete understanding of the model or the meaning of related statements in the record The need for focused argument is particularly strong here where, as we have said, the underlying considerations are detailed, technical, and fact-based The Court departs from our ordinary practice, risks inaccurate judicial decisionmaking, and is unfair to respondents and the courts below For these rea­ sons, we would not disturb the Court of Appeals’ judgment     12 COMCAST CORP v BEHREND GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ , dissenting and, instead, would dismiss the writ as improvidently granted"}

appeals for the ninth circuit No 92–102 Argued March 30, 1993—Decided June 28, 1993 Petitioners, two minor children and their parents, alleged in their suit against respondent that the children’s serious birth defects had been caused by the mothers’ prenatal ingestion of Bendectin, a prescription drug marketed by respondent The District Court granted respondent summary judgment based on a well-credentialed expert’s afﬁdavit concluding, upon reviewing the extensive published scientiﬁc literature on the subject, that maternal use of Bendectin has not been shown to be a risk factor for human birth defects Although petitioners had responded with the testimony of eight other well-credentialed experts, who based their conclusion that Bendectin can cause birth defects on animal studies, chemical structure analyses, and the unpublished “reanalysis” of previously published human statistical studies, the court determined that this evidence did not meet the applicable “general acceptance” standard for the admission of expert testimony The Court of Appeals agreed and afﬁrmed, citing Frye v United States, 54 App D C 46, 47, 293 F 1013, 1014, for the rule that expert opinion based on a scientiﬁc technique is inadmissible unless the technique is “generally accepted” as reliable in the relevant scientiﬁc community Held The Federal Rules of Evidence, not Frye, provide the standard for admitting expert scientiﬁc testimony in a federal trial Pp 585–597 (a) Frye’s “general acceptance” test was superseded by the Rules’ adoption The Rules occupy the ﬁeld, United States v Abel, 469 U S 45, 49, and, although the common law of evidence may serve as an aid to their application, id , at 51–52, respondent’s assertion that they somehow assimilated Frye is unconvincing Nothing in the Rules as a whole or in the text and drafting history of Rule 702, which speciﬁcally governs expert testimony, gives any indication that “general acceptance” is a necessary precondition to the admissibility of scientiﬁc evidence Moreover, such a rigid standard would be at odds with the Rules’ liberal thrust and their general approach of relaxing the traditional barriers to “opinion” testimony Pp 585–589 (b) The Rules—especially Rule 702—place appropriate limits on the admissibility of purportedly scientiﬁc evidence by assigning to the trial 580 DAUBERT v MERRELL DOW PHARMACEUTICALS, INC Syllabus judge the task of ensuring that an expert’s testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand The reliability standard is established by Rule 702’s requirement that an expert’s testimony pertain to “scientiﬁc  knowledge,” since the adjective “scientiﬁc” implies a grounding in science’s methods and procedures, while the word “knowledge” connotes a body of known facts or of ideas inferred from such facts or accepted as true on good grounds The Rule’s requirement that the testimony “assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue” goes primarily to relevance by demanding a valid scientiﬁc connection to the pertinent inquiry as a precondition to admissibility Pp 589–592 (c) Faced with a proffer of expert scientiﬁc testimony under Rule 702, the trial judge, pursuant to Rule 104(a), must make a preliminary assessment of whether the testimony’s underlying reasoning or methodology is scientiﬁcally valid and properly can be applied to the facts at issue Many considerations will bear on the inquiry, including whether the theory or technique in question can be (and has been) tested, whether it has been subjected to peer review and publication, its known or potential error rate and the existence and maintenance of standards controlling its operation, and whether it has attracted widespread acceptance within a relevant scientiﬁc community The inquiry is a ﬂexible one, and its focus must be solely on principles and methodology, not on the conclusions that they generate Throughout, the judge should also be mindful of other applicable Rules Pp 592–595 (d) Cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof, rather than wholesale exclusion under an uncompromising “general acceptance” standard, is the appropriate means by which evidence based on valid principles may be challenged That even limited screening by the trial judge, on occasion, will prevent the jury from hearing of authentic scientiﬁc breakthroughs is simply a consequence of the fact that the Rules are not designed to seek cosmic understanding but, rather, to resolve legal disputes Pp 595–597 951 F 2d 1128, vacated and remanded Blackmun, J , delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court with respect to Parts I and II–A, and the opinion of the

standard for admitting expert scientiﬁc testimony in a federal trial I Petitioners Jason Daubert and Eric Schuller are minor children born with serious birth defects They and their parents sued respondent in California state court, alleging that the birth defects had been caused by the mothers’ ingestion of Bendectin, a prescription antinausea drug marketed by respondent Respondent removed the suits to federal court on diversity grounds After extensive discovery, respondent moved for summary judgment, contending that Bendectin does not cause birth defects in humans and that petitioners would be unable to come forward with any admissible evidence that it does In support of its motion, respondent submitted an afﬁdavit of Steven H Lamm, physician and epidemiologist, who is a well-credentialed expert on the risks from exposure to various chemical substances 1 Doctor Lamm stated that he had reviewed all the literature on Bendectin and human birth defects—more than 30 published studies involving over 130,000 patients No study had found Bendectin to be a human teratogen (i e , a substance capable of causing malformations in fetuses) On the basis of this review, Doctor Lamm concluded that maternal use of Bendectin during the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy has not been shown to be a risk factor for human birth defects by Donald N Bersoff for Alvan R Feinstein by Don M Kennedy, Loretta M Smith, and Richard A Oetheimer and for Kenneth Rothman et al by Neil B Cohen 1 Doctor Lamm received his master’s and doctor of medicine degrees from the University of Southern California He has served as a consultant in birth-defect epidemiology for the National Center for Health Statistics and has published numerous articles on the magnitude of risk from exposure to various chemical and biological substances App 34–44 583 Cite as 509 U S 579 (1993) Opinion of the Court Petitioners did not (and do not) contest this characterization of the published record regarding Bendectin Instead, they responded to respondent’s motion with the testimony of eight experts of their own, each of whom also possessed impressive credentials 2 These experts had concluded that Bendectin can cause birth defects Their conclusions were based upon “in vitro” (test tube) and “in vivo” (live) animal studies that found a link between Bendectin and malformations pharmacological studies of the chemical structure of Bendectin that purported to show similarities between the structure of the drug and that of other substances known to cause birth defects and the “reanalysis” of previously published epidemiological (human statistical) studies The District Court granted respondent’s motion for summary judgment The court stated that scientiﬁc evidence is admissible only if the principle upon which it is based is “ ‘sufﬁciently established to have general acceptance in the ﬁeld to which it belongs ’ ” 727 F Supp 570, 572 (SD Cal 1989), quoting United States v Kilgus, 571 F 2d 508, 510 (CA9 1978) The court concluded that petitioners’ evidence did not meet this standard Given the vast body of epidemiological data concerning Bendectin, the court held, expert opinion which is not based on epidemiological evidence 2 For example, Shanna Helen Swan, who received a master’s degree in biostatistics from Columbia University and a doctorate in statistics from the University of California at Berkeley, is chief of the section of the California Department of Health and Services that determines causes of birth defects and has served as a consultant to the World Health Organization, the Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institutes of Health Id , at 113–114, 131–132 Stuart A Newman, who received his bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Columbia University and his master’s and doctorate in chemistry from the University of Chicago, is a professor at New York Medical College and has spent over a decade studying the effect of chemicals on limb development Id , at 54–56 The credentials of the others are similarly impressive See id , at 61–66, 73–80, 148–153, 187– 192, and Attachments 12, 20, 21, 26, 31, and 32 to Petitioners’ Opposition to Summary Judgment in No 84–2013–G(I) (SD Cal ) 584 DAUBERT v MERRELL DOW PHARMACEUTICALS, INC Opinion of the Court is not admissible to establish causation 727 F Supp , at 575 Thus, the animal-cell studies, live-animal studies, and chemical-structure analyses on which petitioners had relied could not raise by themselves a reasonably disputable jury issue regarding causation Ibid Petitioners’ epidemiological analyses, based as they were on recalculations of data in previously published studies that had found no causal link between the drug and birth defects, were ruled to be inadmissible because they had not been published or subjected to peer review Ibid The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit afﬁrmed 951 F 2d 1128 (1991) Citing Frye v United States, 54 App D C 46, 47, 293 F 1013, 1014 (1923), the court stated that expert opinion based on a scientiﬁc technique is inadmissible unless the technique is “generally accepted” as reliable in the relevant scientiﬁc community 951 F 2d, at 1129–1130 The court declared that expert opinion based on a methodology that diverges “signiﬁcantly from the procedures accepted by recognized authorities in the ﬁeld  cannot be shown to be ‘generally accepted as a reliable technique ’ ” Id , at 1130, quoting United States v Solomon, 753 F 2d 1522, 1526 (CA9 1985) The court emphasized that other Courts of Appeals considering the risks of Bendectin had refused to admit reanalyses of epidemiological studies that had been neither published nor subjected to peer review 951 F 2d, at 1130–1131 Those courts had found unpublished reanalyses “particularly problematic in light of the massive weight of the original published studies supporting [respondent’s] position, all of which had undergone full scrutiny from the scientiﬁc community ” Id , at 1130 Contending that reanalysis is generally accepted by the scientiﬁc community only when it is subjected to veriﬁcation and scrutiny by others in the ﬁeld, the Court of Appeals rejected petitioners’ reanalyses as “unpublished, not subjected to the normal peer review process and generated solely for use in litigation ” Id , at 1131 The 585 Cite as 509 U S 579 (1993) Opinion of the Court court concluded that petitioners’ evidence provided an insufﬁcient foundation to allow admission of expert testimony that Bendectin caused their injuries and, accordingly, that petitioners could not satisfy their burden of proving causation at trial We granted certiorari, 506 U S 914 (1992), in light of sharp divisions among the courts regarding the proper standard for the admission of expert testimony Compare, e g , United States v Shorter, 257 U S App D C 358, 363– 364, 809 F 2d 54, 59–60 (applying the “general acceptance” standard), cert denied, 484 U S 817 (1987), with DeLuca v Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc , 911 F 2d 941, 955 (CA3 1990) (rejecting the “general acceptance” standard) II A In the 70 years since its formulation in the Frye case, the “general acceptance” test has been the dominant standard for determining the admissibility of novel scientiﬁc evidence at trial See E Green C Nesson, Problems, Cases, and Materials on Evidence 649 (1983) Although under increasing attack of late, the rule continues to be followed by a majority of courts, including the Ninth Circuit 3 The Frye test has its origin in a short and citation-free 1923 decision concerning the admissibility of evidence derived from a systolic blood pressure deception test, a crude precursor to the polygraph machine In what has become a famous (perhaps infamous) passage, the then Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia described the device and its operation and declared “Just when a scientiﬁc principle or discovery crosses the line between the experimental and demonstrable stages 3 For a catalog of the many cases on either side of this controversy, see P Giannelli E Imwinkelried, Scientiﬁc Evidence §1–5, pp 10–14 (1986 and Supp 1991) 586 DAUBERT v MERRELL DOW PHARMACEUTICALS, INC Opinion of the Court is difﬁcult to deﬁne Somewhere in this twilight zone the evidential force of the principle must be recognized, and while courts will go a long way in admitting expert testimony deduced from a well-recognized scientiﬁc principle or discovery, the thing from which the deduction is made must be sufﬁciently established to have gained general acceptance in the particular ﬁeld in which it belongs ” 54 App D C , at 47, 293 F , at 1014 (emphasis added) Because the deception test had “not yet gained such standing and scientiﬁc recognition among physiological and psychological authorities as would justify the courts in admitting expert testimony deduced from the discovery, development, and experiments thus far made,” evidence of its results was ruled inadmissible Ibid The merits of the Frye test have been much debated, and scholarship on its proper scope and application is legion 4 4 See, e g , Green,

was superseded by the adoption of the Federal Rules of Evidence 5 We agree We interpret the legislatively enacted Federal Rules of Evidence as we would any statute Beech Aircraft Corp v Rainey, 488 U S 153, 163 (1988) Rule 402 provides the baseline “All relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, by Act of Congress, by these rules, or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible ” “Relevant evidence” is deﬁned as that which has “any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence ” Rule 401 The Rules’ basic standard of relevance thus is a liberal one Frye, of course, predated the Rules by half a century In United States v Abel, 469 U S 45 (1984), we considered the pertinence of background common law in interpreting the Rules

though in the somewhat altered form of a source of guidance in the exercise of delegated powers ’ ” Id , at 51–52 We found the common-law precept at issue in the Abel case entirely consistent with Rule 402’s general requirement of admissibility, and considered it unlikely that the drafters had intended to change the rule Id , at 50–51 In Bourjaily v United States, 483 U S 171 (1987), on the other hand, the Court was unable to ﬁnd a particular common-law doctrine in the Rules, and so held it superseded Here there is a speciﬁc Rule that speaks to the contested issue Rule 702, governing expert testimony, provides “If scientiﬁc, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualiﬁed as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise ” Nothing in the text of this Rule establishes “general acceptance” as an absolute prerequisite to admissibility Nor does respondent present any clear indication that Rule 702 or the Rules as a whole were intended to incorporate a “general acceptance” standard The drafting history makes no mention of Frye, and a rigid “general acceptance” requirement would be at odds with the “liberal thrust” of the Federal Rules and their “general approach of relaxing the traditional barriers to ‘opinion’ testimony ” Beech Aircraft Corp v Rainey, 488 U S , at 169 (citing Rules 701 to 705) See also Weinstein, Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence is 589 Cite as 509 U S 579 (1993) Opinion of the Court Sound It Should Not Be Amended, 138 F R D 631 (1991) (“The Rules were designed to depend primarily upon lawyer-adversaries and sensible triers of fact to evaluate conﬂicts”) Given the Rules’ permissive backdrop and their inclusion of a speciﬁc rule on expert testimony that does not mention “general acceptance,” the assertion that the Rules somehow assimilated Frye is unconvincing Frye made “general acceptance” the exclusive test for admitting expert scientiﬁc testimony That austere standard, absent from, and incompatible with, the Federal Rules of Evidence, should not be applied in federal trials 6 B That the Frye test was displaced by the Rules of Evidence does not mean, however, that the Rules themselves place no limits on the admissibility of purportedly scientiﬁc evidence 7 Nor is the trial judge disabled from screening such evidence To the contrary, under the Rules the trial judge must ensure that any and all scientiﬁc testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant, but reliable The primary locus of this obligation is Rule 702, which clearly contemplates some degree of regulation of the subjects and theories about which an expert may testify “If scientiﬁc, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue” an expert “may testify thereto ” (Emphasis added ) The subject of an expert’s testimony must 6 Because we hold that Frye has been superseded and base the discussion that follows on the content of the congressionally enacted Federal Rules of Evidence, we do not address petitioners’ argument that application of the Frye rule in this diversity case, as the application of a judgemade rule affecting substantive rights, would violate the doctrine of Erie R Co v Tompkins, 304 U S 64 (1938) 7 The Chief Justice “do[es] not doubt that Rule 702 conﬁdes to the judge some gatekeeping responsibility,” post, at 600, but would neither say how it does so nor explain what that role entails We believe the better course is to note the nature and source of the duty 590 DAUBERT v MERRELL DOW PHARMACEUTICALS, INC Opinion of the Court be “scientiﬁc  knowledge ” 8 The adjective “scientiﬁc” implies a grounding in the methods and procedures of science Similarly, the word “knowledge” connotes more than subjective belief or unsupported speculation The term “applies to any body of known facts or to any body of ideas inferred from such facts or accepted as truths on good grounds ” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1252 (1986) Of course, it would be unreasonable to conclude that the subject of scientiﬁc testimony must be “known” to a certainty arguably, there are no certainties in science See, e g , Brief for Nicolaas Bloembergen et al as Amici Curiae 9 (“Indeed, scientists do not assert that they know what is immutably ‘true’—they are committed to searching for new, temporary, theories to explain, as best they can, phenomena”) Brief for American Association for the Advancement of Science et al as Amici Curiae 7–8 (“Science is not an encyclopedic body of knowledge about the universe Instead, it represents a process for proposing and reﬁning theoretical explanations about the world that are subject to further testing and reﬁnement” (emphasis in original)) But, in order to qualify as “scientiﬁc knowledge,” an inference or assertion must be derived by the scientiﬁc method Proposed testimony must be supported by appropriate validation—i e , “good grounds,” based on what is known In short, the requirement that an expert’s testimony pertain to “scientiﬁc knowledge” establishes a standard of evidentiary reliability 9 8 Rule 702 also applies to “technical, or other specialized knowledge ” Our discussion is limited to the scientiﬁc context because that is the nature of the expertise offered here 9 We note that scientists typically distinguish between “validity” (does the principle support what it purports to show?) and “reliability” (does application of the principle produce consistent results?) See Black, 56 Ford L Rev , at 599 Although “the difference between accuracy, validity, and reliability may be such that each is distinct from the other by no more than a hen’s kick,” Starrs, Frye v United States Restructured and Revitalized A Proposal to Amend Federal Evidence Rule 702, 26 Jurimet 591 Cite as 509 U S 579 (1993) Opinion of the Court Rule 702 further requires that the evidence or testimony “assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue ” This condition goes primarily to relevance “Expert testimony which does not relate to any issue in the case is not relevant and, ergo, non-helpful ” 3 Weinstein Berger ¶702[02], p 702–18 See also United States v Downing, 753 F 2d 1224, 1242 (CA3 1985) (“An additional consideration under Rule 702—and another aspect of relevancy—is whether expert testimony proffered in the case is sufﬁciently tied to the facts of the case that it will aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute”) The consideration has been aptly described by Judge Becker as one of “ﬁt ” Ibid “Fit” is not always obvious, and scientiﬁc validity for one purpose is not necessarily scientiﬁc validity for other, unrelated purposes See Starrs, Frye v United States Restructured and Revitalized A Proposal to Amend Federal Evidence Rule 702, 26 Jurimetrics J 249, 258 (1986) The study of the phases of the moon, for example, may provide valid scientiﬁc “knowledge” about whether a certain night was dark, and if darkness is a fact in issue, the knowledge will assist the trier of fact However (absent creditable grounds supporting such a link), evidence that the moon was full on a certain night will not assist the trier of fact in determining whether an individual was unusually likely to have behaved irrationally on that night Rule 702’s “helpfulness” rics J 249, 256 (1986), our reference here is to evidentiary reliability— that is, trustworthiness Cf , e g , Advisory Committee’s Notes on Fed Rule Evid 602, 28 U S C App , p 755 (“ ‘[T]he rule requiring that a witness who testiﬁes to a fact which can be perceived by the senses must have had an opportunity to observe, and must have actually observed the fact’ is a ‘most pervasive manifestation’ of the common law insistence upon ‘the most reliable sources of information’ ” (citation omitted)) Advisory Committee’s Notes on Art VIII of Rules of Evidence, 28 U S C App , p 770 (hearsay exceptions will be recognized only “under circumstances supposed to furnish guarantees of trustworthiness”) In a case involving scientiﬁc evidence, evidentiary reliability will be based upon scientiﬁc validity 592 DAUBERT v MERRELL DOW PHARMACEUTICALS, INC Opinion of the Court standard requires a valid scientiﬁc connection to the pertinent inquiry as a precondition to admissibility That these requirements are embodied in Rule 702 is not surprising Unlike an ordinary witness, see Rule 701, an expert is permitted wide latitude to offer opinions, including those that are not based on ﬁrsthand knowledge or observation See Rules 702 and 703 Presumably, this relaxation of the usual requirement of ﬁrsthand knowledge—a rule which represents “a ‘most pervasive manifestation’ of the common law insistence upon ‘the most reliable sources of information,’ ” Advisory Committee’s Notes on Fed Rule Evid 602, 28 U S C App , p 755 (citation omitted)—is premised on an assumption that the expert’s opinion will have a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of his discipline C Faced with a proffer of expert scientiﬁc testimony, then, the trial judge must determine at the outset, pursuant to Rule 104(a),10 whether the expert is proposing to testify to (1) scientiﬁc knowledge that (2) will assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue 11 This entails a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or method10 Rule 104(a) provides “Preliminary questions concerning the qualiﬁcation of a person to be a witness, the existence of a privilege, or the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court, subject to the provisions of subdivision (b) [pertaining to conditional admissions] In making its determination it is not bound by the rules of evidence except those with respect to privileges ” These matters should be established by a preponderance of proof See Bourjaily v United States, 483 U S 171, 175–176 (1987) 11 Although the Frye decision itself focused exclusively on “novel” scientiﬁc techniques, we do not read the requirements of Rule 702 to apply specially or exclusively to unconventional evidence Of course, wellestablished propositions are less likely to be challenged than those that are novel, and they are more handily defended Indeed, theories that are so ﬁrmly established as to have attained the status of scientiﬁc law, such as the laws of thermodynamics, properly are subject to judicial notice under Federal Rule of Evidence 201 593 Cite as 509 U S 579 (1993) Opinion of the Court ology underlying the testimony is scientiﬁcally valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue We are conﬁdent that federal judges possess the capacity to undertake this review Many factors will bear on the inquiry, and we do not presume to set out a deﬁnitive checklist or test But some general observations are appropriate Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether a theory or technique is scientiﬁc knowledge that will assist the trier of fact will be whether it can be (and has been) tested “Scientiﬁc methodology today is based on generating hypotheses and testing them to see if they can be falsiﬁed indeed, this methodology is what distinguishes science from other ﬁelds of human inquiry ” Green 645 See also C Hempel, Philosophy of Natural Science 49 (1966) (“[T]he statements constituting a scientiﬁc explanation must be capable of empirical test”) K Popper, Conjectures and Refutations The Growth of Scientiﬁc Knowledge 37 (5th ed 1989) (“[T]he criterion of the scientiﬁc status of a theory is its falsiﬁability, or refutability, or testability”) (emphasis deleted) Another pertinent consideration is whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication Publication (which is but one element of peer review) is not a sine qua non of admissibility it does not necessarily correlate with reliability, see S Jasanoff, The Fifth Branch Science Advisors as Policymakers 61–76 (1990), and in some instances well-grounded but innovative theories will not have been published, see Horrobin, The Philosophical Basis of Peer Review and the Suppression of Innovation, 263 JAMA 1438 (1990) Some propositions, moreover, are too particular, too new, or of too limited interest to be published But submission to the scrutiny of the scientiﬁc community is a component of “good science,” in part because it increases the likelihood that substantive ﬂaws in methodology will be detected See J Ziman, Reliable Knowledge An Exploration 594 DAUBERT v MERRELL DOW PHARMACEUTICALS, INC Opinion of the Court of the Grounds for Belief in Science 130–133 (1978) Relman Angell, How Good Is Peer Review?, 321 New Eng J Med 827 (1989) The fact of publication (or lack thereof) in a peer reviewed journal thus will be a relevant, though not dispositive, consideration in assessing the scientiﬁc validity of a particular technique or methodology on which an opinion is premised Additionally, in the case of a particular scientiﬁc technique, the court ordinarily should consider the known or potential rate of error, see, e g , United States v Smith, 869 F 2d 348, 353–354 (CA7 1989) (surveying studies of the error rate of spectrographic voice identiﬁcation technique), and the existence and maintenance of standards controlling the technique’s operation, see United States v Williams, 583 F 2d 1194, 1198 (CA2 1978) (noting professional organization’s standard governing spectrographic analysis), cert denied, 439 U S 1117 (1979) Finally, “general acceptance” can yet have a bearing on the inquiry A “reliability assessment does not require, although it does permit, explicit identiﬁcation of a relevant scientiﬁc community and an express determination of a particular degree of acceptance within that community ” United States v Downing, 753 F 2d, at 1238 See also 3 Weinstein Berger ¶702[03], pp 702–41 to 702–42 Widespread acceptance can be an important factor in ruling particular evidence admissible, and “a known technique which has been able to attract only minimal support within the community,” Downing, 753 F 2d, at 1238, may properly be viewed with skepticism The inquiry envisioned by Rule 702 is, we emphasize, a ﬂexible one 12 Its overarching subject is the scientiﬁc valid12 A number of authorities have presented variations on the reliability approach, each with its own slightly different set of factors See, e g , Downing, 753 F 2d, at 1238–1239

579 (1993) Opinion of the Court ity—and thus the evidentiary relevance and reliability—of the principles that underlie a proposed submission The focus, of course, must be solely on principles and methodology, not on the conclusions that they generate Throughout, a judge assessing a proffer of expert scientiﬁc testimony under Rule 702 should also be mindful of other applicable rules Rule 703 provides that expert opinions based on otherwise inadmissible hearsay are to be admitted only if the facts or data are “of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular ﬁeld in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject ” Rule 706 allows the court at its discretion to procure the assistance of an expert of its own choosing Finally, Rule 403 permits the exclusion of relevant evidence “if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury  ” Judge Weinstein has explained “Expert evidence can be both powerful and quite misleading because of the difﬁculty in evaluating it Because of this risk, the judge in weighing possible prejudice against probative force under Rule 403 of the present rules exercises more control over experts than over lay witnesses ” Weinstein, 138 F R D , at 632 III We conclude by brieﬂy addressing what appear to be two underlying concerns of the parties and amici in this case Respondent expresses apprehension that abandonment of “general acceptance” as the exclusive requirement for admission will result in a “free-for-all” in which befuddled juries are confounded by absurd and irrational pseudoscientiﬁc asing a New Approach to Admissibility, 67 Iowa L Rev 879, 911–912 (1982) and Symposium on Science and the Rules of Evidence, 99 F R D 187, 231 (1983) (statement by Margaret Berger) To the extent that they focus on the reliability of evidence as ensured by the scientiﬁc validity of its underlying principles, all these versions may well have merit, although we express no opinion regarding any of their particular details 596 DAUBERT v MERRELL DOW PHARMACEUTICALS, INC Opinion of the Court sertions In this regard respondent seems to us to be overly pessimistic about the capabilities of the jury and of the adversary system generally Vigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence See Rock v Arkansas, 483 U S 44, 61 (1987) Additionally, in the event the trial court concludes that the scintilla of evidence presented supporting a position is insufﬁcient to allow a reasonable juror to conclude that the position more likely than not is true, the court remains free to direct a judgment, Fed Rule Civ Proc 50(a), and likewise to grant summary judgment, Fed Rule Civ Proc 56 Cf , e g , Turpin v Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc , 959 F 2d 1349 (CA6) (holding that scientiﬁc evidence that provided foundation for expert testimony, viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, was not sufﬁcient to allow a jury to ﬁnd it more probable than not that defendant caused plaintiff’s injury), cert denied, 506 U S 826 (1992) Brock v Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc , 874 F 2d 307 (CA5 1989) (reversing judgment entered on jury verdict for plaintiffs because evidence regarding causation was insufﬁcient), modiﬁed, 884 F 2d 166 (CA5 1989), cert denied, 494 U S 1046 (1990) Green 680–681 These conventional devices, rather than wholesale exclusion under an uncompromising “general acceptance” test, are the appropriate safeguards where the basis of scientiﬁc testimony meets the standards of Rule 702 Petitioners and, to a greater extent, their amici exhibit a different concern They suggest that recognition of a screening role for the judge that allows for the exclusion of “invalid” evidence will sanction a stiﬂing and repressive scientiﬁc orthodoxy and will be inimical to the search for truth See, e g , Brief for Ronald Bayer et al as Amici Curiae It is true that open debate is an essential part of both legal and scientiﬁc analyses Yet there are important differences between the quest for truth in the courtroom and the quest 597 Cite as 509 U S 579 (1993) Opinion of the Court for truth in the laboratory Scientiﬁc conclusions are subject to perpetual revision Law, on the other hand, must resolve disputes ﬁnally and quickly The scientiﬁc project is advanced by broad and wide-ranging consideration of a multitude of hypotheses, for those that are incorrect will eventually be shown to be so, and that in itself is an advance Conjectures that are probably wrong are of little use, however, in the project of reaching a quick, ﬁnal, and binding legal judgment—often of great consequence—about a particular set of events in the past We recognize that, in practice, a gatekeeping role for the judge, no matter how ﬂexible, inevitably on occasion will prevent the jury from learning of authentic insights and innovations That, nevertheless, is the balance that is struck by Rules of Evidence designed not for the exhaustive search for cosmic understanding but for the particularized resolution of legal disputes 13 IV To summarize “General acceptance” is not a necessary precondition to the admissibility of scientiﬁc evidence under the Federal Rules of Evidence, but the Rules of Evidence— especially Rule 702—do assign to the trial judge the task of ensuring that an expert’s testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand Pertinent evidence based on scientiﬁcally valid principles will satisfy those demands The inquiries of the District Court and the Court of Appeals focused almost exclusively on “general acceptance,” as gauged by publication and the decisions of other courts Ac13 This is not to say that judicial interpretation, as opposed to adjudicative factﬁnding, does not share basic characteristics of the scientiﬁc endeavor “The work of a judge is in one sense enduring and in another ephemeral  In the endless process of testing and retesting, there is a constant rejection of the dross and a constant retention of whatever is pure and sound and ﬁne ” B Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 178–179 (1921) 598 DAUBERT v MERRELL DOW PHARMACEUTICALS, INC Opinion of Rehnquist, C J cordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion It is so ordered Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Stevens joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part The petition for certiorari in this case presents two questions ﬁrst, whether the rule of Frye v United States, 54 App D C 46, 293 F 1013 (1923), remains good law after the enactment of the Federal Rules of Evidence and second, if Frye remains valid, whether it requires expert scientiﬁc testimony to have been subjected to a peer review process in order to be admissible The Court concludes, correctly in my view, that the Frye rule did not survive the enactment of the Federal Rules of Evidence, and I therefore join Parts I and II–A of its opinion The second question presented in the petition for certiorari necessarily is mooted by this holding, but the Court nonetheless proceeds to construe Rules 702 and 703 very much in the abstract, and then offers some “general observations ” Ante, at 593 “General observations” by this Court customarily carry great weight with lower federal courts, but the ones offered here suffer from the ﬂaw common to most such observations—they are not applied to deciding whether particular testimony was or was not admissible, and therefore they tend to be not only general, but vague and abstract This is particularly unfortunate in a case such as this, where the ultimate legal question depends on an appreciation of one or more bodies of knowledge not judicially noticeable, and subject to different interpretations in the briefs of the parties and their amici Twenty-two amicus briefs have been ﬁled in the case, and indeed the Court’s opinion contains no fewer than 37 citations to amicus briefs and other secondary sources 599 Cite as 509 U S 579 (1993) Opinion of Rehnquist, C J The various briefs ﬁled in this case are markedly different from typical briefs, in that large parts of them do not deal with decided cases or statutory language—the sort of material we customarily interpret Instead, they deal with deﬁnitions of scientiﬁc knowledge, scientiﬁc method, scientiﬁc validity, and peer review—in short, matters far aﬁeld from the expertise of judges This is not to say that such materials are not useful or even necessary in deciding how Rule 702 should be applied but it is to say that the unusual subject matter should cause us to proceed with great caution in deciding more than we have to, because our reach can so easily exceed our grasp But even if it were desirable to make “general observations” not necessary to decide the questions presented, I cannot subscribe to some of the observations made by the Court In Part II–B, the Court concludes that reliability and relevancy are the touchstones of the admissibility of expert testimony Ante, at 590–592 Federal Rule of Evidence 402 provides, as the Court points out, that “[e]vidence which is not relevant is not admissible ” But there is no similar reference in the Rule to “reliability ” The Court constructs its argument by parsing the language “[i]f scientiﬁc, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,  an expert  may testify thereto  ” Fed Rule Evid 702 It stresses that the subject of the expert’s testimony must be “scientiﬁc  knowledge,” and points out that “scientiﬁc” “implies a grounding in the methods and procedures of science” and that the word “knowledge” “connotes more than subjective belief or unsupported speculation ” Ante, at 590 From this it concludes that “scientiﬁc knowledge” must be “derived by the scientiﬁc method ” Ibid Proposed testimony, we are told, must be supported by “appropriate validation ” Ibid Indeed, in footnote 9, the Court decides that “[i]n a case involving scientiﬁc evidence, eviden 600 DAUBERT v MERRELL DOW PHARMACEUTICALS, INC Opinion of Rehnquist, C J tiary reliability will be based upon scientiﬁc validity ” Ante, at 591, n 9 (emphasis in original) Questions arise simply from reading this part of the Court’s opinion, and countless more questions will surely arise when hundreds of district judges try to apply its teaching to particular offers of expert testimony Does all of this dicta apply to an expert seeking to testify on the basis of “technical or other specialized knowledge”—the other types of expert knowledge to which Rule 702 applies—or are the “general observations” limited only to “scientiﬁc knowledge”? What is the difference between scientiﬁc knowledge and technical knowledge does Rule 702 actually contemplate that the phrase “scientiﬁc, technical, or other specialized knowledge” be broken down into numerous subspecies of expertise, or did its authors simply pick general descriptive language covering the sort of expert testimony which courts have customarily received? The Court speaks of its conﬁdence that federal judges can make a “preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientiﬁcally valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue ” Ante, at 592–593 The Court then states that a “key question” to be answered in deciding whether something is “scientiﬁc knowledge” “will be whether it can be (and has been) tested ” Ante, at 593 Following this sentence are three quotations from treatises, which not only speak of empirical testing, but one of which states that the “ ‘criterion of the scientiﬁc status of a theory is its falsiﬁability, or refutability, or testability ’ ” Ibid I defer to no one in my conﬁdence in federal judges but I am at a loss to know what is meant when it is said that the scientiﬁc status of a theory depends on its “falsiﬁability,” and I suspect some of them will be, too I do not doubt that Rule 702 conﬁdes to the judge some gatekeeping responsibility in deciding questions of the admissibility of proffered expert testimony But I do not think 601 Cite as 509 U S 579 (1993) Opinion of Rehnquist, C J it imposes on them either the obligation or the authority to become amateur scientists in order to perform that role I think the Court would be far better advised in this case to decide only the questions presented, and to leave the further development of this important area of the law to future cases"}

for personal computers and servers It also produces applications software that run on the Windows family of operating systems, most notably the very successful MS-Office Suite consisting of Word (word processor), Excel (spreadsheet), PowerPoint (presentations), Outlook (e-mail and news), and Access (database) 1 Almost all Microsoft products are complementary to a member of the Windows family of operating systems for personal computers and servers  During the last few years, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice of the United States have investigated Microsoft on various antitrust allegations The 1991-1993 and 1993-1994 investigations by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) ended with no lawsuits The 1994 investigation2 by the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) was terminated with a consent decree in 1995 3 The key provisions of the 1995 consent decree were  1 Microsoft agreed to end “per-processor” (zero marginal price) contracts with computer manufacturers (Original Equipment Manufacturers, “OEMs”) but it was allowed to use unrestricted quantity discounts  2 “Microsoft shall not enter into any License Agreement in which the terms of that agreement are expressly or impliedly conditioned upon the licensing of any other Covered Product, Operating System Software product or other product (provided, however, that this provision in and of itself shall not be construed to prohibit Microsoft from developing integrated products) or the OEM not licensing, purchasing, using or distributing any non-Microsoft product ”4 Thus, the 1995 consent decree imposes two restrictions, one horizontal, and one vertical The horizontal restriction stops Microsoft from using zero marginal cost pricing                1 Microsoft produces software, including operating systems for PC (Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000), operating systems for local network and Internet servers (Windows NT, 2000), “back-office” products for network and Internet servers, Internet clients, Internet and network servers, desktop applications (Office, Word, Excel, Access, Outlook, PowerPoint, MS-Money, etc ), games, and programming languages (Visual Basic, Java) Microsoft also produces services, including Internet service (MSN, WebTV), Internet content (MSN), and product support, and some hardware such as branded mice, keyboards, etc  2 DOJ sued Microsoft on July 15, 1994, under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, alleging that Microsoft had entered into licensing agreements with OEMs that prevented other operating system vendors from gaining widespread distribution of their products  3 The Court entered the consent decree as its Final Judgment on April 21, 1995  4 Final Judgment, Civil Action No 94-1564  4 However, it allows for quantity discounts, disregarding the fact that zero marginal cost pricing is a special case of a quantity discount contract 5  The vertical restriction of the 1995 consent decree prohibits product bundling created by contract, but allows Microsoft to keep expanding the number and type of functions of its products, including Windows In short, in the 1995 consent decree contractual bundling was disallowed, but technological bundling was explicitly allowed 6 During 1997, Senator Orin Hatch (R-Utah) held congressional hearings on Microsoft that featured Microsoft’s CEO Bill Gates, Netscape’s CEO Jim Barksdale, Sun CEO Scott McNealy, and PC manufacturer Michael Dell, among others Senator Hatch took the position that if present antitrust law cannot deal with various anti-competitive acts attributed to Microsoft, Congress should change or enhance the antitrust laws 7 Sun Microsystems, Oracle, IBM, Netscape, and Novell formed a loose coalition lobbying intensely for antitrust action against Microsoft 8 On October 20, 1997, DOJ alleged that Microsoft violated the 1995 consent decree by bundling Internet Explorer (“IE”) with the Windows operating systems, and requiring computer manufacturers to distribute IE with Windows 95 DOJ petitioned the District Court to find Microsoft in civil contempt On December 11, 1997, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued a preliminary injunction barring the bundling of IE with Windows 9 On May 12, 1998, the Court of Appeals (DC Circuit) voided the 1997 preliminary injunction On June 23, 1998, the Court of Appeals ruled that the 1995 consent decree did not apply to Windows 98, which was shipped with an integrated IE as                5 This is a apparent contradiction in the terms of the consent decree Clearly, the zero marginal price contract is a special case of a quantity discount contract, more generally referred to by economists as a non-linear pricing contract If quantity discounts are allowed, but a zero marginal price is not (as the consent decree reads), it is not clear how low the marginal price is allowed to be so that the consent decree is not violated  6 Microsoft has expanded over the years before and after the 1995 consent decree the functionality included in Windows, leading to the elimination of some stand-alone add-ons markets For example, Microsoft included a disk defragmenter in Windows 1995 and the market for defragmenters promptly died Similarly, when hard disk compression was included in Windows 1995, the market for disk compression software died However, the market for fax software survived and expanded after the inclusion of fax capabilities in Windows 1995  7 Hatch (1999)  8 See, for example, Reback et al (1994) Gary Reback represented Netscape and was instrumental in creating this loose coalition, as well as providing the main arguments that the government used in this case Brinkley and Lohr (2000), page 326, also mention a Netscape “white paper” written by Wilson Sonsini lawyers Gary Reback and Susan Creighton and entitled “White Paper Regarding the Recent Anticompetitive Conduct of the Microsoft Corporation,” dated 1996, which was never made public but was made available to the New York Times reporters  9 The Court also referred the issue to a special master, Prof Lawrence Lessig of Harvard  5 part of the operating system and an IE icon on the PC desktop, arguing that “courts are ill equipped to evaluate the benefits of high-tech product design ”10 During the week following the Court of Appeals stay of Judge Jackson’s preliminary injunction that barred the bundling of IE with Windows because of the alleged violation of the 1995 consent decree, DOJ filed a major antitrust suit against Microsoft In this action (DOJ Complaint 98-12320), filed on May 18, 1998, DOJ was joined by the Attorneys General of 20 States and the District of Columbia This paper focuses on this last and continuing lawsuit against Microsoft  Over the years, Microsoft has integrated in the Windows class of operating systems many functions and features that were originally performed by stand-alone products 11 Moreover, the Court of Appeals in its June 23, 1998 decision affirmed that Microsoft’s practice of bundling IE with Windows was legal under the terms of the 1995 consent decree To overcome this interpretation of the law, DOJ argued that Microsoft’s bundling of IE with Windows and its attempt to eliminate Netscape as a competitor in the browser market was much more than adding functionality to Windows and marginalizing a series of add-on software manufacturers DOJ alleged (and the District Court concurred) that Microsoft added browser functionality to Windows and marginalized Netscape because Netscape posed a potential competitive threat to the Windows operating system This distinctive threat posed by Netscape was a crucial part of the DOJ allegations DOJ alleged that applications could be written to be executed “on top” of Netscape since Netscape could be run on a number of operating systems, DOJ alleged that Netscape could erode the market power of Windows In DOJ’s logic, Microsoft gave away IE and integrated it in Windows so that Netscape would not become a platform that would compete with Windows Thus, DOJ alleged that Microsoft’s free distribution of IE, its bundling with Windows, and all its attempts to win the browser wars were defensive moves by Microsoft to protect its Windows monopoly  The Microsoft trial took place at an accelerated schedule at the U S District Court of the District of Columbia from October 19, 1998 to June 24, 1999 Only twelve witnesses testified from each side Microsoft’s CEO Bill Gates was not called as a witness, but his video taped deposition was extensively used during the trial Judge Jackson pre-announced that he would announce his “findings of fact” before his “conclusions of law ” This was widely interpreted as implying that the judge was trying to give an opportunity to the sides to reach a compromise and resolve the case through a consent decree  On November 5, 1999, Judge Jackson issued his “findings of fact,” siding very strongly with the plaintiffs In December 1999, Judge Richard Posner, a prominent                10 The Court of Appeals further noted that “the limited competence of courts to evaluate high-tech product designs and the high cost of error should make them wary of second-guessing the claimed benefits of a particular design decision ” 147 F 3d at 950 n 13  11 For example, disk compression and disk de-fragmentation were not part of Windows 3 1 and were added to Windows 95 and 98   6 antitrust scholar and the Chief Judge of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, agreed to serve as mediator for settlement discussions 12 On April 1, 2000, settlement talks broke down after some States reportedly disagreed with the proposed agreement 13 On April 3, 2000, Judge Jackson issued his “conclusions of law” finding for the plaintiffs on almost all points In particular, Judge Jackson found Microsoft liable for monopolization and anti-competitive tying of IE with Windows but found that Microsoft’s exclusive contracts did not make it liable for preventing Netscape from being distributed  On June 7, 2000, after an extremely short hearing,14 Judge Jackson issued his remedies decision, splitting Microsoft into two companies, and imposing severe business conduct restrictions Microsoft appealed, and was granted a stay of all parts of the District Court decisions until the appeal is heard Although the Washington DC Appeals Court expressed its willingness to hear the case in plenary session, the District Court agreed with the government’s proposal to petition the Supreme Court to hear the case immediately, invoking a rarely used provision of antitrust law 15 On September 26, 2000, the Supreme Court indicated that it will not hear the case before the Court of Appeals Thus, the appeals process is likely to take at least a year, and more likely two years It is widely believed that the Federal lawsuit will be settled during the administration of president George W Bush, who had stated during his election campaign that he will only pursue price fixing antitrust cases 16 The nature and scope of the allegations in this case imply that its final outcome will determine the terms of competition in the software industry and more generally in network industries To a large extent, the application of antitrust law in network industries is hampered by the fact that rigorous economic analysis of network industries is relatively new  The rest of this paper has the

defense Section 5 summarizes the key sections of antitrust law relevant to this case Section 6 outlines the District Court Judge’s “findings of fact” and “conclusions of law ” Section 7 analyzes the

2000  14 The hearing was on May 24, 2000 It started at 10 15 am, ended around 3 30 pm, and included a two-hour lunch break  15 DOJ argued that review by the Supreme Court was appropriate to expedite the final judgment because of the importance of the case for the national economy However, it is worth noting that the plaintiffs had a real interest to avoid the DC Court of Appeals since that Court ruled (June 23, 1998) on the issue of bundling Internet Explorer and Windows 95 in the earlier Microsoft case exactly in the opposite way to Judge Jackson’s decision on bundling in the case being appealed  16 Financial Times, June 26, 2000, Interview with George W Bush  7 allegation of tying Windows with IE Section 9 analyzes the allegation of attempted monopolization of the browser market

Effects In assessing the Microsoft case, it is important to remember that the case focuses on markets with network effects Network effects define crucial features of market structure that have to be taken into consideration in understanding competition and potentially anti-competitive actions in these markets  A market exhibits network effects (or network externalities)17 when the value to a buyer of an extra unit is higher when more units are sold, everything else being equal In a traditional network, network externalities arise because a typical subscriber can reach more subscribers in a larger network 18 In a virtual network,19 network externalities arise because larger sales of component A induce larger availability of complementary components B1, , Bn, thereby increasing the value of component A The increased value of component A results in further positive feedback 20 For example, the existence of an abundance of Windows-compatible applications increases the value of Windows  There are a number of crucial features of markets with network effects that distinguish them from other markets First, markets with strong network effects where firms can chose their own technical standards are “winner-take-most” markets That is, in these markets, there is extreme market share and profits inequality 21 The market share of the largest firm can easily be a multiple of the market share of the second largest, the second largest firm’s market share can be a multiple of the market share of the third, and so on This geometric sequence of market shares implies that, even for small n, the nth firm’s market share is tiny  For example, abundance of applications written for Windows increases the value of Windows and induces more consumers to buy Windows This increases the incentive                17 The word externality means that a good’s value is not intermediated in a market For the purposes of this paper, we will use the words “network effects” and “network externalities” interchangeably  18 See Economides (1996)  19 A virtual network is a collection of compatible goods (that share a common technical platform) For example, all VHS video players make up a virtual network Similarly, all computers running Windows 98 can be thought of as a virtual network  20 Despite the cycle of positive feedbacks, it is typically expected that the value of component A does not explode to infinity because the additional positive feedback is expected to decrease with increases in the size of the network  21 See Economides and Flyer (1998)  8 for independent applications writers to write applications for Windows, and this further increases sales and market share for Windows Moreover, consumers are willing to pay more for the brand with the highest market share (since it has more associated applications), and therefore profits associated with this brand can be a large multiple of profits of other platforms This implies a very large market share for Windows, a small market share for the Mac, a very small market share for the third competitor, and almost negligible shares for the fourth and other competitors  Second, due to the natural extreme inequality in market shares and profits in such markets at any point in time, there should be no presumption that there were anticompetitive actions that were responsible for the creation of the market share inequality or the very high profitability of a top firm Great inequality in sales and profits is the natural equilibrium in markets with network externalities and incompatible technical standards No anti-competitive acts are necessary to create this inequality 22 Third, because “winner takes most” is the natural equilibrium in these markets, attempting to superimpose a different market structure, (say one of all firms having approximately equal market shares), is futile and counterproductive If a different market structure is imposed by a singular structural act (say a breakup of a dominant firm), the market would naturally deviate from it and instead converge to the natural inequality equilibrium If forced equality is imposed as a permanent condition, it would create significant social inefficiency, as discussed below  Fourth, in network markets, once few firms are in operation, the addition of new competitors, say under conditions of free entry, does not change the market structure in any significant way The addition of a fourth competitor to a triopoly hardly changes the market shares, prices, and profits of the three top competitors 23 This is true under                22 Litan et al (2000) err in reasoning that Microsoft’s very high profitability is a clear indication of monopolization in the antitrust sense High profitability for the top platform is natural in this winner-takemost market  23 See Economides and Flyer (1998) The table below, taken from this paper, shows market coverage and prices as the number of firms with incompatible platforms increases Maximum potential sales was normalized to 1  Table 1 Quantities, Market Coverage, And Prices Among Incompatible Platforms Number of firms I Sales of largest firm q1 Sales of second

eliminating barriers to entry can encourage competition, the resulting competition does not significantly affect market structure In markets with strong network effects, antitrust authorities cannot significantly affect equilibrium market structure by eliminating barriers to entry  Fifth, the fact that the natural equilibrium in network industries is winner-takemost with very significant market inequality does not imply that competition is weak Competition on which firm will create the top platform and reap most of the benefits is, in fact, very intense  Sixth, there is a more fundamental concern about the application of antitrust in network industries 24 In industries with significant network externalities, under conditions of incompatibility between competing platforms, monopoly may maximize social surplus When strong network effects are present, a very large market share of one platform creates significant network benefits for this platform which contribute to large consumers’ and producers’ surpluses It is possible to have situations where a breakup of a monopoly into two competing firms of incompatible standards reduces rather than increases social surplus because network externalities benefits are reduced This is another way of saying that de facto standardization is valuable, even if done by a monopolist 25 Seventh, in network industries, the costs of entry may be higher but the rewards of success may also be higher compared to non-network industries Thus, it is unclear if there is going to be less entry in network industries compared to traditional industries If a requirement for entry is innovation, one can read the previous statement as saying that it is unclear if innovation would be more or less intense in network industries The dynamics of the innovation process in the winner-take-most environment of network industries are not sufficiently understood by academic economists so that they could give credible advice on this issue to antitrust authorities However, in the last two decades we                                            Note that the addition of the fourth firm onward makes practically no difference in the sales and prices of the top three firms  24 In the Microsoft case, both sides had the chance to address this issue, but failed to do so  25 Economides and Flyer (1998), show that, in market conditions similar to the ones in the OS software market, social welfare (total social surplus) can be higher in monopoly The table below, taken from this paper, shows profits, consumers’ and total surplus in a market where firms produce incompatible products, as the number of competitors I increases  Table 2 Profits, Consumers’ And Total Surplus Among Incompatible Platforms Total number of firms I Profits of largest firm Π1

existence of an installed base of consumers favors an incumbent However, competitors with significant product advantages or a better pricing strategy can overcome the advantage of an installed base 26 Network effects intensify competition, and an entrant with a significantly better product can unseat the incumbent In network industries, we often observe Schumpeterian races for market dominance This is a consequence of the winner-take-most natural equilibrium combined with the high intensity of competition that network externalities imply  3 The Allegations On May 18, 1998, the United States Department of Justice, and the Attorneys General of 20 States27 and the District of Columbia sued Microsoft The main allegations were  1 Microsoft illegally monopolized the market for operating systems (“OSs”) for personal computers (“PCs”) under ¶ 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act  2 Microsoft had anti-competitive contractual arrangements with various vendors of related goods, such as with computer manufacturers (“OEMs”) and Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”), and had taken other actions to preserve and enhance its monopoly that these contractual arrangements and other actions were illegal under ¶ 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act  3 Microsoft illegally attempted to monopolize the market for Internet browsers (but failed to succeed), an act that is illegal under ¶ 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act  4 Microsoft bundled anti-competitively its Internet browser, IE, the Microsoft Internet browser, with its Windows operating systems that this is illegal under ¶ 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act                26 A clear example of this is the win of VHS over Beta in the United States consumer video recorders market Beta was first to market and had a significant installed base in the five years of the coexistence of the two competing standards However, because VHS (i) introduced earlier a recording tape of longer duration (ii) used wide and inexpensive licensing of its technology and (iii) its licensees had a much wider distribution system, VHS emerged as the winner, and Sony stopped selling Beta recorders to the US consumer market  27 The plaintiff States were California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin Originally South Carolina was part of the lawsuit but dropped out of the case soon after the acquisition of Netscape by America Online (“AOL”) and Sun Microsystems (“Sun”) stating that this acquisition has eliminated any anti-competitive concerns  11 4 Microsoft’s Defense Microsoft’s defense was as follows First, Microsoft argued that the law was on its side since the Court of Appeals had ruled on June 23, 1998 that Microsoft can legally add new features and functions to Windows Therefore Microsoft argued that it was legal to add IE’s functionality to Windows, and it had done nothing wrong by integrating IE in Windows  Second, Microsoft argued that it was just competing hard against Netscape, that such competition was welfare-enhancing, and that it did not commit any anti-competitive acts  Third, Microsoft argued that it did not have monopoly power in the operating systems market  Fourth, Microsoft argued that competition in the software sector was intense and that its leadership position could be replaced at any time by a new competitor or entrant Although this seems to have been a deeply held belief of Microsoft’s management (as revealed by the internal e-mails), its economics expert witness failed to convincingly articulate this Schumpeterian view in the context of an antitrust defense  Fifth, Microsoft argued that it is a leader in software innovation and that it has enhanced rather than hobbled the innovation process  Sixth, Microsoft argued that consumers have benefited from its actions rather than been harmed by them Microsoft claimed direct consumer benefits from its low pricing of the operating system, the zero pricing of its Internet browser, and from its enhancement and acceleration of the innovation process Microsoft also argued (rather ineffectively) that consumers benefit from the de facto standardization that its large market share brought to the operating systems market  5 The Law The analysis of DOJ’s allegations and Microsoft’s defenses requires an examination of antitrust law as it currently applies in the United States, the facts of the case, and a synthesis that will define the extent of the violations of the law We start with the examination of antitrust law as it applies to this case  We review the antitrust law in the areas that apply to the Microsoft case Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act states  “Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony ”  12 The U S antitrust law, as presently interpreted, implies that “monopolization” under ¶ 2 of the Sherman Act is illegal if the offender took anti-competitive actions to acquire, preserve, or enhance its monopoly For “monopolization,” plaintiffs have to prove that the defendant 1 Possessed market power and 2 willfully acquired or maintained this monopoly power as distinguished from acquisition through a superior product, business acumen, or historical accident Therefore, contrary to popular belief, for monopolization to be illegal under U S antitrust law, it is not sufficient for a company to “monopolize” a market in the sense of possessing a very large market share, even a market share of 100%  U S antitrust law, as presently interpreted, implies that “attempting to monopolize” is illegal under ¶ 2 of Sherman Antitrust Act if the specific actions taken have anti-competitive consequences For example, bundling, and, more generally, price discrimination could be illegal if they have anti-competitive consequences Similarly, exclusionary contracts (which restrict distribution or production) could be illegal if they have anti-competitive effects  To prove “attempting to monopolize” (under Sherman Act ¶ 2), plaintiffs have to prove that the defendant 1 Engaged in predatory or anti-competitive conduct 2 with specific intent to monopolize 3 and that there was a “dangerous probability” that the defendant would succeed in achieving monopoly power  Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act states  “Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal ” Thus, unreasonable “restraint of competition” is illegal under ¶ 1 of the Sherman Act this may include tying of products or other exclusive arrangements   It has generally been accepted in the application of antitrust law in the United States that anticompetitive acts harm consumers Consumer harm or attempted harm is necessary for an antitrust violation The affected consumer group may be present or future Consumers may lose directly from high prices or indirectly through a limitation of choices of variety and quality or by a retardation of the innovation process But without consumer victims or prospective likely victims, present or future, it is extremely hard to prove that an antitrust violation exists  6 The Judge’s “Findings Of Fact” And “Conclusions Of Law”  13 The U S District Court’s “findings of fact” (November 1999) and “conclusions of law” (April 2000) find for the plaintiffs (U S Department of Justice and 19 States) in almost all the allegations against Microsoft In particular, Judge Penfield Jackson found  1 The relevant antitrust market is the PC operating systems market for Intelcompatible computers 2 Microsoft has a monopoly in this market “where it enjoys a large and stable market share ” 3 Microsoft’s monopoly is protected by the “applications barrier to entry,” which the judge defines as the availability of an abundance of applications running Windows 4 Microsoft used its monopoly power in the PC operating systems market to exclude rivals and harm competitors 5 Microsoft hobbled the innovation process 6 Microsoft’s actions harmed consumers 7 Various Microsoft contracts had anti-competitive implications, but Microsoft is not guilty of anti-competitive exclusive dealing contracts hindering the distribution of Netscape Navigator  7 On Monopolization Of The Operating Systems Market a Market Definition The definition of a market for antitrust purposes is crucial for the determination of liability Traditionally, an antitrust market definition is based on substitution considerations To define the market one has to examine the product Windows was sold to OEMs and users as an operating system on which they could run software applications Windows also contained a variety of functions that were provided free of charge to independent software vendors (“ISVs”) so that they would find it easier, cheaper, and faster to create applications for Windows Microsoft sold to ISVs various tools so that they would utilize these functions of Windows, and provided a variety of free services to ISVs Clearly ISVs were subsidized in kind so that they would write applications for Windows DOJ and the District Court decided to ignore the market relationship between ISVs and Microsoft and to focus exclusively on the sale of Windows to OEMs  DOJ proposed and the District Court Judge agreed that the relevant antitrust market was the market for operating systems for personal computers that are based on an Intel-compatible Central Processing Unit (“CPU”) In this respect, the judge took a rather narrow and static view of the market It is clear that consumers demand applications services from personal computers and would be willing to switch their purchases to non-Intel-compatible PCs if these computers were offered with similar applications as Intel-based PCs and at attractive prices Thus, non-Intel-compatible computers, operating systems and software are substitutes for Intel-compatible computers, operating systems and software If one takes a static view and considers the software applications written for each computer and operating system as given and unchanging (as the judge did), then there is no close substitute for Windows that can run  14 as many applications as Windows does In this static view, all substitutes for Windows are much less valuable because they can run so few applications compared to Windows In a more dynamic view, if new software applications can be written for an operating system (or old ones originally written for other operating systems “ported to” it), an operating system can easily have close substitutes  The dynamic view of market definition invites an examination of the incentives that ISVs have to create such applications Their incentives are not just defined by the price of the operating system to OEMs and final consumers, and by the number of units that the operating system is expected to sell over the lifetime of their applications ISVs use functions that are embedded in an operating system or platform to perform certain operations that are necessary for their applications The more such functions are available in an operating system, and the easier they are to access, the more likely it is for an ISV to write an application for the OS Thus, the availability, abundance, and ease of use of embedded functions in the operating system that can be utilized by an ISV needs to be calibrated in order to define the extent of the market in the dynamic view of market definition  Early in the trial, Microsoft argued that the concept of market definition for antitrust purposes was inappropriate for the dynamic setting of software markets This position was not very well articulated, and hardly appropriate for a District Court Judge who was very unlikely to subscribe to a major revision to traditional application of antitrust law Later in the trial, Microsoft argued through its economic witness that platforms rather than operating systems were the appropriate domain for antitrust analysis, stressing the fact that functions embedded in platforms are used by ISVs to cut their costs of writing applications However, a full and coherent view of a dynamic market definition was never presented  b Barriers To Entry  A crucial tenet of DOJ’s and the District Court’s argument on monopolization was that there are significant barriers to entry in the market for operating systems for personal computers Barriers to entry are asymmetric costs that entrants incur but are not incurred by incumbents Software has a very large fixed cost and a very low (almost zero) marginal cost The fixed cost required to create an operating system could create a barrier to entry to the extent that it is sunk by the incumbent(s), while it has to be paid by an entrant in the current period However, this barrier to entry is not very significant, given the size of the market  The main barrier to entry could be created by the abundance of applications that run on Windows It is estimated that Windows runs 70,000 applications, while the Macintosh and the Linux operating systems run far fewer applications Currently, there are also applications that run on servers connected with the World Wide Web and are essentially independent of the operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc ) of the client The number of applications that can be run on an operating system can be thought of as a quality index What determines the existence and the extent of the “applications  15 barrier to entry” is the extent that costs incurred today by entrants are already sunk by the incumbent The fact that an industry has a high fixed cost or requires investment to induce others to create complementary goods, by itself is not enough to conclude that there are barriers to entry To judge whether barriers to entry exist, one has to examine if, in the relevant time frame, the entrants are facing asymmetrically higher costs than the incumbent(s)  It is clear that, early in its history, Microsoft understood the importance of an abundance of applications for its operating systems To achieve this, Microsoft provided various inducements to independent applications developers to write applications for its operating systems A key inducement for independent applications developers has been the availability of functions in Windows that are useful for applications developers For example, Windows and other operating systems include programming code that makes it easy for an application to print to any of a large number of printers 28 Since this function is available in the operating system, applications developers do not have to write their own programming code to accomplish this function It follows that applications are now cheaper and quicker to write  Microsoft spends considerable resources to attract independent software developers to write for its operating system and to include in the operating system a variety of functions that they find useful It is clear that the abundance of applications for Windows makes Windows more valuable, and therefore increases Microsoft’s potential profits This is clearly a pro-competitive reason for Microsoft to invest in resources to attract independent software developers Given the same number of competitors in the operating systems market, a firm enhances its competitive position by investing resources in order to attract applications to its operating system At the same time, such an increase in the number of applications available for an operating system makes it very difficult for new entrants to profitably enter and survive Thus, increasing the number of applications available for an operating system, although it may have a purely competitive justification, both increases the cost of entry in the operating systems market, and creates the potential for anti-competitive exploitation  On the other hand, to the extent that the incumbent is currently spending resources to attract applications to its operating system, the difference between the costs faced by the incumbent and a potential entrant is reduced, and therefore barriers to entry are reduced Thus, the existence, extent, and importance of an “applications barrier to entry” depends on an empirical examination of the extent to which Microsoft spends resources in the current time frame to attract applications to Windows, and the extent to which Microsoft has already sunk such costs in past time periods Such an examination was not performed by the District Court  c Existence Of Market Power And Pricing Of The Operating System                28 This function was not available in DOS Thus, each application written for DOS had to include large numbers printer drivers that made sure that the application would be able to print on users’ printers  16 The judge ruled that Microsoft has monopoly power in the OS market for Intelcompatible PCs In antitrust, it is generally understood that a firm has monopoly power when it has the sustained ability to control price or exclude competitors The existence of significant barriers to entry and the very high market share of Microsoft in the operating systems market gave indications that Microsoft had monopoly power But there was also a very strong indication to the contrary Microsoft priced its operating system to Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) at an average price of $40-60, a ridiculously low price compared to the static monopoly price 29 Microsoft’s economic witness showed that the static monopoly price was about $1,800, a large multiple of Microsoft’s actual price 30 At first glance, it seems that Microsoft could not possibly have monopoly power in OSs when its OS price is about 3% of the monopoly price  Understanding and explaining the very low price of Windows is important for understanding what Microsoft’s competitive position was and how Microsoft thought of it Plaintiffs failed to explain Microsoft’s pricing by either assuming it away or giving spurious explanations First, the government claimed that pricing significantly above marginal cost was evidence of monopoly power, and that the discrepancy between actual and theoretical monopoly price did not matter But, any software is priced significantly above marginal cost since marginal cost is zero, and the government has not yet sued other software manufacturers on these grounds Second, the government’s economic witnesses claimed that the static monopoly model of the plaintiffs did not apply, but offered no alternative model that could explain the difference between the actual price and the monopoly price of the static model Third, the government claimed that a large                29 It is very likely that the marginal price for the last unit sold to the same OEM was extremely low since the 1995 consent decree allowed Microsoft to have quantity discounts but barred it from zero marginal cost pricing  30 The derivation of the monopoly price for Windows follows Let pH be the price of the PC hardware (everything except Windows) and let pW be the price of Windows Assume that Windows is installed on all PCs, i e , that Microsoft has 100% market share Since hardware and software are combined in a ratio of 1 1, the demand of a PC with Windows is D(pH + pW) Profits of Microsoft from Windows sales are  ΠW = pW D(pH + pW) - FW where FW is the fixed cost of developing Windows, and the marginal cost is negligible Maximizing ΠW implies marginal revenue equals marginal cost, i e ,  D(pH + pW) + pW dD/dpW = 0 ⇔ 1 + [pW /(pH + pW)][(pH + pW)/D][dD/dpW] = 0 ⇔ pW /(pH + pW) = 1/ ε , or equivalently, the monopoly price of Windows is pW = pH/( ε - 1), where ε = -[(pH + pW)/D]/[dD/dpW] is the market elasticity of demand for PCs with Windows If one assumes that the average price of PC hardware is $1,800 and the elasticity is ε = 2, the monopoly price of Windows is pW = $1,800 Even if one assumes a much higher elasticity, ε = 3, and a much lower average price of PC hardware at $1,200, the monopoly price is $600, which is ten to twelve times the price charged by Microsoft to OEMs   17 market elasticity and revenues from complementary goods were sufficient to justify that the actual price was equal to the monopoly price But the required elasticities are very large and inconsistent with the price to cost margins of hardware manufacturers 31 Why was the price of Windows low? For the early periods of each operating system, one expects that the existence of network effects would prompt Microsoft to charge a low price so that each platform becomes accepted by independent software developers as well as users and the bandwagon gets rolling This network-effects-based theory does not explain why Microsoft did not increase the prices of each generation of operating systems as each one matured It also does not explain why Microsoft did not increase significantly its price of Windows as it doubled its market share in the past four years  A variation of the network effects-induced low price theory gives a predatory flavor to Microsoft’s strategy In this view, Microsoft priced low to hook consumers and generate network effects, while it planned to increase the price “in the future ” This theory is particularly implausible because Microsoft dominates the PC desktop market and has doubled its market share in recent years without increasing the price for Windows while expanding its functionality How long will Microsoft wait until it increases the price of Windows? Some even claim that in a network industry, a firm can practice predation without ever increasing the price, but just benefiting in the future from the network effects But such a strategy is indistinguishable from a truly competitive strategy and cannot be considered predatory  A number of other theories have been proposed to explain Microsoft’s pricing Some claim that the availability of an existing installed base of Windows constrained Microsoft’s pricing That could have been true if in fact Windows could easily and legally be uninstalled by users But Microsoft’s licensing requirements and the sheer complexity of the uninstallation operation make it almost impossible for a user to uninstall a Windows operating system that was installed by an OEM and move it to a different (presumably new) computer So the Windows installed base does not constrain Windows pricing  Others claim that the fact that software is durable constrains Windows pricing It is true that once Windows runs on an overwhelming market share of PCs, the substitute for a new Windows computer is an old Windows computer The fact that computers and software are both durable makes this true But very rapid technological change has prompted consumers to buy new computers much faster than traditional obsolescence rates would imply Even doubling the price of Windows to OEMs would not have implied a significant change to the final price of the combined computer and operating system So, durability of software and durability of computers, although a factor, is                31 In the Windows monopoly price formula pW = pH/( ε - 1), if the PC hardware price of $1,800 one requires an elasticity of ε = 31 to get a Windows monopoly price of $60 A PC hardware price of $1,200 one requires an elasticity of ε = 21 to get a Windows monopoly price of $60 It is extremely unlikely that that the market for PCs exhibits such large market elasticities  18 unlikely to explain the huge difference between the actual price and the static monopoly price  Still others claim that the low price is implied by the very low cost of pirating software If that were the case, it would have prompted Microsoft to cut its much higher prices of MS-Office and other software, since pirating takes the same effort and has the same costs for pirates irrespective of the type of software being pirated Moreover, the control that Microsoft can exert on piracy of the operating system is much greater than on piracy of applications Therefore, although piracy could have been more of a problem if the OS software was much more expensive, it is unlikely that the price of Windows is low because of piracy considerations  Finally some claim that Microsoft kept the price of Windows low because that allowed Microsoft to charge more for complementary goods that it produces, such as the Microsoft Office suite There are three reasons that make this argument unlikely to be correct First, Microsoft also produces its most popular products, including the Microsoft Office suite, for the Mac If Microsoft kept the price of Windows low so that is sold MSOffice for Windows at a high price, then the price of MS-Office for Macs should have been lower than the price of MS-Office for Windows, which is factually incorrect Second, Windows has the ability to collect surplus from the whole assortment of applications that run on top of it Keeping Windows’ price artificially low would subsidize not only MS-Office, but also the whole array of tens of thousands of Windows applications that are not produced by Microsoft Therefore, even if Microsoft had a monopoly in the Office market, keeping the price of Windows low is definitely not the optimal way to collect surplus Third, even receiving large per unit revenues from complementary goods cannot by itself explain the vast difference between the actual and the monopoly price of Windows 32 Microsoft claimed that its low pricing was due to actual and potential competition Microsoft’s internal e-mails point to a real fear that the company would be overtaken by the next innovator Even if objectively it is difficult to see the big threat from potential competitors, it is clear that Microsoft’s executives constantly felt the fear of potential competition On the pricing of Windows, I am inclined to believe Microsoft’s view Microsoft priced low because of the threat of competition This means that Microsoft believed that it could not price higher if it were to maintain its market                32 Suppose Microsoft receives net revenue RC sold from goods that are complementary to Windows for every unit of Windows sold Then its profits are  ΠW = (pW + RC)D(pH + pW) - FW  Then the monopoly price of Windows is pW = pH/( ε - 1) - RC  Even if Microsoft makes a net revenue RC = $200 from complementary goods from every unit of Windows sold, when pH = $1,800 and ε = 2, the monopoly price of Windows is pW = $1,600, and when pH = $1,200 and ε = 3, the monopoly price of Windows is pW = $400, vastly above the actual price  19 position In essence, Microsoft pricing reveals that to a large extent its executives believed that market conditions (most importantly potential competition) constrained higher prices  d Exercise Of Market Power The government claimed that Microsoft’s actions to exclude and marginalize Netscape were sufficient to show that Microsoft possessed and exercised its monopoly power Essentially the government claimed that even if Microsoft did not exercise monopoly power in pricing, it was sufficient to show that it exercised it in exclusionary actions But, most economists would agree that it is much more profitable to exercise market power by increasing price than by raising the costs of rivals 33 If Microsoft consistently sells at low prices, it loses a large amount of potential profits It is very hard to make a convincing argument that it is worth sacrificing these profits just to exclude a future potential competitor After all, even if the potential competitor is successful in entering, it could only reduce Microsoft’s future profits, which are worth less today  The government’s and the judge’s theory was that Microsoft exercised its monopoly power by attempting to marginalize Netscape The government and the judge agree that Microsoft attempted to marginalize Netscape’s browser because Microsoft feared that Netscape would become a rival platform to Windows According to this point of view, once Netscape became such a platform, applications would be written to run on Netscape Navigator Moreover, the bigger Netscape’s market share, the more likely it is that ISVs would write applications for the Netscape platform it follows that, in DOJ’s view, competition in OSs is maximized when Netscape has a monopoly in browsers  Since Netscape Navigator could run on many operating systems (not just Windows), therefore, from this perspective, Netscape created a threat to Windows In this view, all actions to aggressively compete with Netscape were just attempts by Microsoft to defend its monopoly in PC operating systems  This is an interesting theoretical argument, but it has both theoretical and empirical deficiencies First, in winner-take-most competition, DOJ’s analysis fails to distinguish between profit sacrifices to keep out potential rivals and competition where a company keeps its prices low in order to win consumer business from actual and potential rivals Second, although at some point in time Marc Andreesen, Netscape’s CTO, claimed that Netscape would create the capabilities of running applications, there was never a consistent effort by Netscape to create a comprehensive set of Applications Product Interfaces (“APIs”) that would support typical applications that now run under Windows Moreover, Netscape hardly put sufficient effort and resources in reaching independent applications developers to write for such a platform So, although potentially Netscape could have created such a platform, it was very far away from that goal, and the probability of succeeding against the array of Windows applications was low                33 The exception is regulated industries where a firm is not free to increase price  20 Third, Netscape, even if successful, is likely to have been limited to Internetbased applications The performance of such applications is dependent on the Internet working efficiently and at top speed Actual performance would also potentially be hampered by excessive loads on the CPUs of servers where the applications would actually run Essentially the model of Netscape as competitor of operating systems required a number of contingencies to be met, and therefore faced a very significant uncertainty If instead applications were to run on the PC itself (on top of Netscape) they would need to interface to some extent with the underlying operating system If this system was Windows, then it would be unlikely that it would accommodate perfectly its direct competitor  Fourth, Microsoft’s actions clearly could have had competitive justifications Microsoft’s management saw that the Internet was taking off and wanted to have a dominant position in it  DOJ and the District Court Judge also agreed that Microsoft sabotaged Sun’s Java operating language so that Java would not become a “universal language” in the sense that applications written for it could be run in any operating system Over the years, the computer industry has gone through a number of such pipe dream “universal languages ” They have all failed for a very simple reason a “universal language” cannot be too specialized -- after all it has to be recognizable by diverse operating systems But efficiency and speed in program execution requires specialization Universal languages eventually fail because they get more and more efficient for particular operating systems and thereby their universality fails 34 Microsoft created an implementation of Java for Windows that was more efficient than the original Java by Sun Microsoft’s implementation (that is, Microsoft’s Java virtual machine) allowed for all programs written for the original (“pure”) Java to be run on it Thus, it preserved backward compatibility with the original Java that ran on all operating systems Because of that, Microsoft’s actions were not anti-competitive Microsoft claims that Sun’s non-OS-specific Java language was inefficient and slow, and that Microsoft improved it This is a reasonable pro-competitive justification for Microsoft’s actions The fact that Microsoft’s Java implementation also runs programs that do not run in other Java implementations is not cause for anti-competitive concern, especially since Microsoft has published the function calls its Java makes to Windows Competing operating systems could implement these calls 35  A key economic witness of DOJ, Prof Frank Fisher of MIT, proposed in pre-trial filings and supported during the trial a novel theory of predation The traditional theory of predation requires that a product is sold below incremental (or “avoidable”) cost for a                34 The fate of human languages is similar As each language becomes more efficient for a certain group it gets more specialized and cannot easily be understood by the rest of the world  35 This discussion is limited to antitrust considerations and does not discuss the contractual dispute between Microsoft and Sun  21 period of time until competitors are driven out of business then the monopolist increases prices and reaps its monopoly profit 36 Instead Prof Fisher calls an action predatory if it would not have been profitable (and therefore not undertaken) in the long run unless the predator was taking into consideration profits arising out of the negative impact of the practice on competition 37 According to this definition of predation, predation can occur even when the predator sets price above incremental cost, or even above average cost All that is required for predation, according to Prof Fisher, is for a company to take some (presumably very aggressive) action that would not be rewarding unless competitors are hurt If this definition is to be adopted, a large array of actions that are normal business practice and which benefit consumers are going to be characterized as predatory and therefore illegal  In antitrust economics, it is widely believed that rules should be fashioned to maximized social surplus The Fisher rule fails to do so It creates an artificial cushion of profits If an aggressive competitor dares to take away some of these profits, he is named a predator Moreover, since the profit cushion is created without regard to cost, it can be at any status quo level Instead of promoting competition and efficiency, the Fisher predation theory could protect slack and monopoly rents The judge erred to the extent that he based his ruling on this incorrect theory  To understand better Prof Fisher’s definition of predation, consider the following example Suppose that in a two-firm industry, firm 1 has constant average unit cost equal of $10, while firm 2 has constant average unit cost of $15 An “accommodation strategy” of firm 1 would be to charge a price above $15 (say $16), so that the market is shared between firms 1 and 2 Suppose that firm 1 plays an “aggressive strategy” and charges a unit price of $14 Such an action results in a profit for firm 1 of $4 for every unit sold in the market These profits are likely to be higher than the profits firm 1 would have received in the accommodation strategy of $16 The accommodation strategy gives a profit of $6 per unit sold by firm 1 and, since firm 1 sells only half the output, its profit is $3 for every unit sold in the market If the market is not extremely elastic, firm 1 makes more profits if it uses the aggressive strategy, which drives firm 2 out of business Applying Prof Fisher’s predation definition, firm 1 is a predator because its aggressive action increased its monopoly rent Moreover, in comparison with the “accommodation strategy,” the aggressive strategy would have not been taken if it were not trying to increase its monopoly rent  If the “aggressive strategy” is considered predatory and therefore illegal according to Prof Fisher’s criterion and firm 1 uses the “accommodation strategy” instead, total and consumers’ surplus will decrease Consumers will face a higher price of $16 rather than $14 and will therefore be worse off Moreover, firm 2 will be producing half the units sold at a cost that is higher by $5 than the most efficient production cost, thereby reducing total surplus It is evident that application of Prof Fisher’s predation criterion                36 See, for example, Areeda and Kaplow (1997), p 512, 514  37 Specifically Prof Fisher’s standard is that an action is anti-competitive when such an action “would not be profit maximizing except for the monopoly rents earned or protected by the action ”  22 can result in lower consumers and total surplus Moreover, the application of this criterion shields the less efficient firm from competition and guarantees its rents  8 On Tying Of Windows With Internet Explorer As we have seen, the District Court ruled that Microsoft had monopoly power in the operating systems market Judge Jackson further ruled that the Internet browser market was separate from the market for operating systems, and that technological and contractual tying of Internet Explorer with Windows raised prices and hurt consumers The judge ruled that consumers do not want IE even free of charge because it burdens the OS with memory and overhead requirements, and it consumes a significant amount of hard disk space  There is a major contradiction in the District Court’s decision In the Sherman ¶2 part of the case, browsers are in the same market as operating systems, but in the Sherman ¶1 part of the case, browsers and operating systems are in different markets On the one hand, in the tying part of the case, the Judge ruled that Internet browsers are in a separate market from PC operating systems On the other hand, in the monopolization part of the case, the Judge ruled that Microsoft attempted to marginalize the Netscape browser to defend its Windows monopoly because the Netscape browser was (or was becoming) a close substitute for Windows If Internet browsers are in a separate market from the operating systems market, then Microsoft’s actions in the browser market in the monopolization part of the case cannot be interpreted as defending Microsoft’s monopoly If instead the browser is in the same market as Windows, there cannot be illegal tying  Microsoft claimed that IE was giving crucial functionality to its operating system and had every right to include it in Windows under the terms of the 1995 consent decree which allowed addition of functions and features to Windows Although this is a legal matter, I believe that the consent decree’s language is plain enough to allow one to conclude that Microsoft’s view is correct   But why did Microsoft produce a browser and why did it then give it away? Essentially the question is what is the appropriate behavior in a complementary goods market for a firm that has a dominant position in one market? That is, does it make sense from a competitive point of view that Microsoft was giving away the browser at no charge, or was it an anti-competitive act? To understand this, we first outline some thoughts about extracting value from complementary goods chains, where one good has close complements that are used in conjunction with it 38 First, a firm in one market is better off and can extract more value when the complementary markets in which it does not participate are more competitive Conversely, the more monopolized a market is, the less value remains for the                38 This discussion follows closely Economides (1999)   23 complementary markets Second, keep in mind that value can be extracted only once from the chain of components If a firm can monopolize one component, and all other complementary component markets are perfectly competitive, the firm gains nothing by attempting to monopolize the complementary component markets The value of a good or service cannot be extracted more than once, no matter how many components the good is broken into But, a firm that monopolizes a component has an incentive to enter and compete hard in a market for a complementary component if the complementary component market is not perfectly competitive, because by entering such a market, the firm can capture rents that it was losing from its original market Third, more generally, a firm that participates in a market that is not perfectly competitive has a stronger incentive to enter a (not perfectly competitive) market for a complementary component than a firm that does not participate in any other market Otherwise put, when complementary component markets are not perfectly competitive, there are strong incentives for the same firms to enter more than one of these markets Fourth, when a component, say component A, is used together with many other complementary components, say B1, , Bn, to produce n composite goods of varying market values, competitors in the market for A will tend to enter the markets for the complementary components that, in combination with A, have the highest market value   The entry of Microsoft in the browser market can be seen in the context of competition and multi-market participation in markets for complementary components As long as the market for browsers was competitive and was shared by a number of browsers, and as long as the Internet was a small academic market, Microsoft had no significant business interest in it When the browser market became dominated by Netscape, and, simultaneously, the Internet market appeared to be significantly larger, Microsoft integrated browser features in Windows and significantly improved its browser Again, there were two reasons for this First, Netscape had a dominant position in the browser market, thereby taking away from Microsoft’s operating system profits to the extent that Windows was used together with the Navigator Second, as the markets for Internet applications and electronic commerce exploded, the potential loss to Microsoft from not having a top browser increased significantly These reasons were sufficient to drive Microsoft to produce a browser  Was the free distribution of IE anti-competitive? Clearly, Microsoft had a procompetitive incentive to freely distribute IE since that would stimulate demand for the Windows platform Were there anti-competitive effects? If one assumes (as DOJ does in the tying part of the case) that the two markets (operating systems and browsers) are separate and therefore tying occurred, the crucial question is whether tying was anticompetitive In particular, was the incremental increase in the price of Windows when IE was bundled with it larger than the price increase justified by the value of functionality that IE added? This is the test that the Court should have conducted, and it failed to do so My view is that it is very hard to prove that a quality-adjusted new version of Windows without IE would not have had a higher hedonic price than old Windows That is, a modest increase in the market price of Windows was likely to be justified by the enhancement of features of Windows even without the inclusion of IE Thus, if the Court had performed this test, I believe it is likely that it would have found that adding IE  24 functionality to new versions of Windows and distributing IE free of charge for older versions of Windows and for other operating systems did not harm consumers  9 On Attempting To Monopolize The Browser Market The District Court Judge found that Microsoft lost money while trying to gain market share from Netscape, in its attempt to monopolize the browser market by leveraging its monopoly of the OS market The Judge also found that Microsoft failed in this attempt  It is well understood that the potential surplus of a consumer for a unit of a good can only be extracted once If Microsoft is able to extract the surplus of a consumer that buys an Internet browser through Windows, it has no incentive to try to monopolize the market for browsers, as long as the market for browsers is competitive To the extent that the market for browsers is monopolized, it can take away from the surplus appropriated by Windows, and then Microsoft may have an incentive to expand its market share in browsers There is significant evidence that the market for browsers was originally monopolized by Netscape Then the inroad of Microsoft into browsers replaced a monopoly with duopoly And, it brought the price to zero and intensified research and development in browsers to the great benefit of consumers It is quite ironic that, although the inroad of Microsoft into browsers was greatly beneficial to consumers and broke the Netscape monopoly, the government and the judge found Microsoft’s actions anti-competitive  10 Other Potentially Anti-competitive Arrangements The court proceeding spent a significant amount of time on potentially anticompetitive actions of Microsoft in its dealings with buyers, content providers and others An examination of the various arrangements and the facts of each one of them is impossible in this article due to of lack of space Broadly speaking, the potentially anticompetitive actions were of three kinds 1 Contracts with OEMs on the distribution of Netscape and IE, and the lack of control by OEMs of the opening screen (“first screen”) of a new PC 2 Contracts with ISPs (such as AOL) on the distribution of Netscape and IE 3 Control by Microsoft or OEMs of “active channels” to be provided to Internet Content Providers (such as Disney) The potentially anti-competitive effects of such contracts have to be judged on a case by case basis  11 Effects On Consumers In principle, there are three ways that consumers could be hurt by potentially anticompetitive actions First, consumers may be hurt because these actions increase prices Second, consumers may be hurt because these actions may limit their choices in terms of  25 variety and quality Third, these actions may limit innovative activity, thereby hurting future consumers Any harm in any of these three dimensions should be evaluated and balanced with any benefit of these actions in other dimensions It is customary in antitrust cases to value the benefits to consumers and balance them with the burden of anti-competitive actions The District Court failed to do this task The Court did not attempt to quantify the benefits to consumers from giving away Internet Explorer and the intensification of competition that resulted Also, the Court did not try to assign a monetary value to the losses to consumers resulting from the anti-competitive actions for which it found Microsoft liable  Consumers have directly benefited from the free distribution of Internet Explorer as well as its bundling and tight integration with Windows When Microsoft started to seriously compete with Netscape in the Internet browser market, Netscape -- essentially the sole provider of Internet browser software -- charged non-academic users $40-50 to use its browser 39 Microsoft, by contrast, gave its Internet browser away Netscape responded to the introduction of IE version 4 that many held of superior or comparable quality to Netscape by giving its browser away as well Today, with at least 100 million browsers installed in the United States, Microsoft’s actions have created a benefit of at least $4 to $5 billion to American consumers And, since Microsoft’s actions intensified competition, which in turn produced higher quality browsers, they provided further benefits to consumers  The District Court Judge ruled that the prices of Windows 95 and 98 were too high, based on internal Microsoft e-mails that discussed a range of prices considered by the company for pricing Windows However, consumers may have directly benefited from the relatively low price of Windows Since the marginal cost of Windows is almost zero, clearly Microsoft had a wide range of prices it could have used The static monopoly price for Windows was thirty to forty times higher Microsoft’s operating system, for which computer manufacturers pay $40-60 per copy, is cheap compared to the historical and current prices of other operating systems For example, in the late 1980s, IBM sold OS/2 (which ran much fewer applications than Windows) for hundreds of dollars Some Linux packages -- essentially add-ons to the free Linux source code – currently sell for $150, and run far fewer applications than Windows does These price discrepancies highlight a huge contradiction in the government’s case and in the judge’s findings of fact If Microsoft were a true malevolent monopoly unconstrained by potential competition, it would charge far more for Windows than it does The annual consumer benefits from Windows’ relatively low price may be many billions of dollars  The District Court judge ruled that Microsoft’s action of distributing Internet Explorer at no charge “increased [the] general familiarity with the Internet and reduced the cost to the public of gaining access to it,” “gave Netscape an incentive to improve Navigator’s quality,” and benefited consumers since it “compelled Netscape to stop                39 Netscape was distributed free of charge to academic and governmental institutions Netscape was also distributed free of charge to all in its introductory stage  26 charging for Navigator ”40 On the other hand, the District Court judge ruled that consumers were hurt in various ways by Microsoft’s anti-competitive actions The judge ruled that consumers were hurt41 because they could not get Windows without a browser since Microsoft “forced OEMs to ignore consumer demand for a browserless version of Windows,” and that the inclusion of Internet Explorer led to “degraded system performance, and restricted memory ” I believe that the Judge erred in ruling that free distribution of IE significantly harmed consumers by degrading performance and restricting available computer memory First, because IE has been integrated into Windows, it is very hard to judge how a computer would work without it, how much memory it would use, how quickly it would run, etc One would have to construct a computer with some other new component of the OS taking over the functions that IE performs now in Windows, and then test it The Court failed to do so, and cannot conclusively rule on this issue Second, the Internet-related tasks of operating systems are in very high demand as the Internet is presently in an exponential expansion path The number of consumers who have been harmed in the way suggested by the Judge is likely to be very small, and in an age of cheap computers, memory, and hard drive capacity, their losses could not be very large  Netscape and Internet Explorer ended up being very similar products in terms of their functionality Most computer magazines rate recent versions of IE above Netscape’s There does not seem to be any loss in variety or quality by the domination of the browser market by IE Windows-based computers can run both IE and Navigator simultaneously, and users are not forced to choose one to the exclusion of the other One could use one browser for some tasks and another for others   The court ignored the issue of compatibility which was probably the most central issue in the case Backward and forward compatibility are crucial for software markets, and, as explained earlier, are the source of network effects Microsoft provides de facto compatibility through its Windows operating systems Compatibility is an important benefit to society because it is the source of network effects Compatibility and its benefits could be quickly eliminated or significantly reduced if Microsoft is broken into competing pieces Microsoft did not forcefully present to the Court the benefits to society of its dominant position arising from the de facto compatibility it created and the resulting network effects  Finally on the issue of innovation, economists’ opinions are split on whether monopoly or competition would create more innovation Economists’ opinions are also split on whether vertically integrated or independent companies create more innovation The government’s economic witnesses did not provide any specific theory to support the                40 Findings of Fact, United States v Microsoft, Civil Action No 98-1232 (TPJ) State of New York v Microsoft Civil Action No 98-1233 (TPJ), thereafter (“FOF”), at paragraph 408  41 FOF at paragraph 410  27 claim that Microsoft was damaging the innovation process The theory that general fear of Microsoft kept competitors out of the market or without available capital is contradicted by the abundant support by financial markets of the successful entry of a number of Linux variants  12 Remedies a Remedies As Imposed By The District Court The issue of remedies was from the very beginning the most difficult part of the litigation Many observers that believed that Microsoft was liable had expressed privately great consternation in finding an appropriate remedy Given the variety of remarks of Judge Jackson during the trial, there was no doubt that the District Court would have found Microsoft liable Even before the trial started, it seemed that the remedies determination would be the most crucial and most interesting element of the process It was widely expected that the remedies phase would be a new full scale trial with significant input by economists  Instead, Judge Jackson decided on remedies in summary fashion without any examination of the proposals of all sides He was quoted shortly afterwards arguing that since the plaintiffs won the liability phase, the plaintiffs should have the right to determine the remedies  In the last week of March 2000, the New York Times published the terms of the Microsoft and DOJ negotiations conducted under Judge Posner’s supervision The published information implied that DOJ and Microsoft were not far from an agreement, but that some States that were part of the litigation disagreed with the settlement terms The terms of the final draft of the proposal of DOJ were 42 1 Microsoft would create a pricing schedule that would apply to all buyers, so that prices would not be conditioned on other Microsoft products that a buyer buys The schedule would allow for different prices for different quantities 2 Microsoft would not be allowed to have exclusive contracts that do not allow the other party to use, display, or feature its opponents products 3 Microsoft would be required to share technical information without discrimination among the potential recipients of this information 4 Microsoft would be required to disclose the application interfaces (APIs) that link applications to Windows 5 Microsoft cannot increase the price of old versions of Windows when new versions are released Microsoft would be forced to sell the old version at a constant price for three years after a new release 6 Microsoft would produce a Windows version without IE Computer manufacturers would be allowed to license some part of the Windows code so that they could change the opening screen, and choose the default browser                42 New York Times, April 2, 2000 See also Brinkley and Lohr (2000), page 286-7  28 7 Tying by contract would be prohibited, but Microsoft would be allowed to integrate functions, applications, and features in its products 43 This list of conditions seemed a reasonable basis on which a deal with Microsoft could be struck Since these were the government’s proposals, one expects that the final negotiated settlement would have been somewhat less harsh on Microsoft It was widely reported that some States officials considered these remedies as less harsh than they wished for These States officials communicated to Judge Posner that they would not sign such a deal Judge Posner was forced to declare the negotiations a failure  Given the proposals that the government offered in the negotiations, there was a wide expectation that DOJ would demand more or less the same terms in the remedies phase 44 Instead, DOJ asked for a much more radical step a breakup of Microsoft  The plaintiffs remedies proposal as adopted by the Judge imposed a breakup of Microsoft into two “Baby Bills,”45 an operating systems company which would inherit all the operating systems software, and an “applications” company with all the remaining software assets Cash and securities holdings of other companies held by Microsoft would be split between the resulting entities Bill Gates and other officers / shareholders of the company would not be allowed to hold executive and ownership positions in both of the resulting companies The District Court ruling also imposed interim conduct restrictions on Microsoft These restrictions, to last three years, from the time of the breakup were 1 Microsoft would create a pricing schedule that would apply to all buyers, so that price would not be conditioned on the sale of other Microsoft products  2 Microsoft would not be allowed to have exclusive contracts that do not allow the other party to use, display, or feature its opponents products 3 APIs and other technical information of Windows should be shared with outsiders as it is shared within Microsoft 4 Microsoft is not allowed to take actions against manufacturers who feature competitors’ software 5 Microsoft will allow OEMs to alter Windows in significant ways 6 Microsoft is not allowed to design Windows to disable or compromise rivals’ products                43 This seems identical to the provision of the 1995 decree which the DOJ claimed at the beginning of this lawsuit was not restricting Microsoft enough  44 In fact, Prof Harry First who was acting as Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust for the State of New York was quoted in the New York Times (April 30, 2000) saying that he and other officials of the States were expecting DOJ to propose remedies similar to DOJ’s proposals at the negotiations, and were very surprised when Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein informed them a few days before the filing that DOJ would propose a breakup Also see Brinkley and Lohr (2000), pages 306-7  45 This is a word play on “Baby Bells” that came out of AT T and the first name of the CEO of Microsoft, Bill Gates  29 These conditions are similar but more restrictive than the ones proposed by the government in the settlement talks at the end of March 2000 At that point in time the government was satisfied that these restrictions, together with a ban on tying and a requirement that Microsoft would produce a version of Windows without IE, were sufficient to settle the case DOJ did not produce any significant reason that made it change its position Moreover, DOJ did not produce any convincing argument that the proposed breakup would be more efficient or effective than the conduct restrictions that it had proposed earlier  In arguing for the break-up, the government put forward a number of reasons But, since there was only a summary formal hearing on remedies, there was no chance for both the government’s and Microsoft’s cases on remedies to be discussed and evaluated The government and the judge have stated (formally and informally) the following arguments for a breakup 1 That it considered the repeated violations of antitrust law by Microsoft as an indication that Microsoft would not follow any conduct or contractual restrictions in fact, in some informal remarks, government officials believe that they were “tricked” by Microsoft in settling the 1995 case with terms that Microsoft was able to exploit 2 That the lack of remorse by Microsoft’s executives was a clear indication that Microsoft “could not be trusted” to implement any other remedy 3 That the breakup was a “surgical cut” that would create the least interference with business 4 AT T and the rest of the telecommunications industry benefited from AT T’s breakup, and so should Microsoft and the software industry after all both industries have network effects 5 The breakup eliminates the incentive for vertical foreclosure and 6 The breakup reduces the “applications barrier to entry” since now the applications company might write popular Microsoft applications (such as MS-Office) for other platforms  I believe that the government has failed to show that the proposed breakup is the appropriate remedy DOJ had to show that conduct remedies would not work and it failed to do so DOJ has not performed the appropriate cost-benefit analysis to show that conduct remedies are not sufficient and that a breakup is necessary None of the economists affidavits in the remedies phase even come close to discussing and evaluating alternatives As discussed earlier, the government also failed to justify why it was ready to compromise a few weeks earlier on behavioral remedies but now it claimed that structural remedies were necessary  The first argument of the government does not stand to reason The 1995 case was settled with a decree that explicitly stated that Microsoft can include in its operating system any additional functionality It is reasonable that Microsoft (or any observer, including DOJ) would believe, given the 1995 consent decree, that adding browser functionality to Windows does not violate the consent decree This, of course, does not mean that adding such functionality does not violate antitrust law in general, but it puts to  30 its death the idea that the government was tricked by Microsoft Of course, it stands to reason that Microsoft understood much more clearly what the degree said than DOJ since Microsoft understood the business better and could predict what functions could be included in the operating system However, the fact that companies and antitrust enforcers often have an asymmetry of information is very common and expected, and cannot be considered a “trick,” or a reason not to enter into agreements between antitrust authorities and companies  The second argument of the plaintiffs makes no sense at all Antitrust enforcement is not an emotional tug of war in which the egos of the either the plaintiffs or the defendants need to be satisfied The show of remorse or lack thereof by Microsoft executives could not possibly define the remedy I find it hard to believe that the judge would really find a different remedy appropriate if enough Microsoft executives simply showed public remorse Moreover, Microsoft, like any other defendant, has a right to appeal Belief that it will prevail on appeal in a civil case is hardly worthy of punishment  The third argument, that the breakup is a surgical cut and therefore will disrupt the industry the least is countered by the facts A breakup of Microsoft, if it is finally ordered at the end of the appeals process, would, practically speaking, eliminate Microsoft as a flexible and formidable competitor The wholehearted endorsement of the breakup by Microsoft’s competitors in the servers and backoffice competitors (who were not alleged to have been damaged by the Windows monopoly but will greatly benefit from the confusion and disruption created by a Microsoft breakup) is evidence that the breakup is one of the most disruptive possible outcomes  The fourth argument, that since AT T’s 1982 breakup was successful so would Microsoft’s, is incorrect AT T was divided into the long-distance company (AT T), and seven regional operating companies, each of which remained a regulated local telecommunications monopoly until 1996 The destruction of AT T’s long-distance monopoly encouraged competition, which brought sharply lower prices and immense consumer benefits 46 There are a number of key differences between the two companies and their competitive situations And these differences make it very likely that a Microsoft breakup, besides harming Microsoft, would harm consumers and the computer industry  In 1981, AT T was a 100-year-old regulated monopoly with many layers of management For historical reasons, the local phone companies within the old AT T, such as New York Telephone, were managed separately from the “long lines” division Thus, it was not difficult to separate the divisions since they functioned on many levels as separate companies AT T also had an abundance of managers to help cope with the                46 At the same time the AT T breakup did not introduce competition at the local exchange level, and the Regional Bell Operating Companies (“RBOCs”) were allowed to monopolize local telecommunications services as well as access to long distance services The success of competition in long distance has been hampered by the continuing monopoly of the local exchange, four years after the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was supposed to open the local exchange to competition  31 breakup By contrast, Microsoft is a young, entrepreneurial company run by very few top executives (about 25), and its divisions are very fluid While this has made Microsoft one of the most efficient and successful companies around, it also means that a break-up would pose significant managerial problems and severely reduce the company’s flexibility Finally, AT T was a regulated utility and regulation guaranteed that the companies emerging from the breakup stayed interconnected In contrast, the Microsoft breakup is likely to lead to incompatibilities and further loss of efficiency  DOJ’s two-way breakup plan was premised on the hope that an autonomous applications company would create a new operating system to compete with Windows But more than 70,000 applications run on Windows, creating what the government calls “the applications barrier to entry” in the operating-system market However capable the new applications company, it still wouldn’t be able to single-handedly create a successful rival operating system Separately, even with a new applications company’s support, Microsoft’s biggest operating-system competitor, Linux, is unlikely to become a serious desktop threat to Windows  In my opinion, the breakup as proposed by the government and imposed by the District Court will have detrimental effects First, the breakup is likely to result in higher prices If DOJ is correct and Microsoft kept its OS prices low so that it can exercise its monopoly power in the adjacent browser market, the post-breakup Baby Bill that inherits the operating systems will have no incentive to keep the price low The OS Baby Bill will no longer have the incentive to disadvantage any applications companies Thus, if DOJ’s theories are correct, the OS Baby Bill will now exercise the monopoly power it has and raise the price of the operating system to the detriment of consumers If DOJ is correct and Microsoft has significant monopoly power because of the “applications barrier to entry,” higher prices will be the direct result of the breakup Second, as explained earlier, the breakup is likely to eliminate the efficiencies that make Microsoft a flexible and formidable competitor  The breakup is likely to temporarily eliminate the incentive for interference from OSs to applications and vice versa Of course, the same could have been accomplished by conduct restrictions without the cost and the disruption of the breakup Moreover, the District Court did not impose permanent restrictions on the post-breakup functions of the companies The OS and the applications Baby Bills may enter into each other’s business soon after the breakup It is very likely that a few years after the breakup, one of the resulting companies will dominate both markets  b Other Remedies Proposals A number of other remedies proposal have been discussed in the literature, but unfortunately were not discussed in the District Court’s summary remedies proceedings If the liability conviction is upheld by the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, it is likely that the issue of remedies will be re-opened and a full hearing on remedies may take place  32 In principle, remedies fall into two broad classes First there are those that attack the business side of Microsoft by restricting its contracts or splitting the company along various lines of business The second broad class attacks the control over the technology by either forcing Microsoft to release or license the source code, or to disclose proprietary information (APIs) The remedies can also be divided into those that affect conduct and those that affect structure For example, a restriction on contracts is a conduct remedy, while a breakup is a structural remedy  Provided that the liability conviction is upheld, four alternatives have been proposed One remedy proposal is even more extreme than the one imposed by the judge This extreme proposal would break up Microsoft into three identical Baby Bills, with each company acquiring the source code of all the programs that Microsoft currently sells, and one third of its employees 47 This “horizontal remedy” is sometimes presented in combination with the “vertical remedy” imposed by the judge In this “hybrid remedy,” first Microsoft is broken into two or three companies according to the type of program produced, and then the operating systems company is broken into three parts creating four of five companies altogether  Besides the loss of flexibility that any breakup would create, a horizontal or hybrid breakup would also produce significant incompatibilities with harmful effects to computer users, applications writers, and Microsoft shareholders Baby Bills coming out of a horizontal or a hybrid breakup will have incentives to create incompatible versions of Windows for two reasons First, Baby Bills will try to differentiate their operating systems to avoid strong competition, leading to small price-cost margins This is true even in industries without network externalities and has been well established in the economics literature on product differentiation 48 Second, Baby Bills will try to make their operating systems incompatible with each other in a race to become the dominant OS, since the dominant firm receives the lion’s share of profits in a winner-takes-most world This is established in the network economics literature 49 Differentiating the operating systems by Baby Bills would inevitably reduce the range of software that would be compatible with each user’s computer As a consequence, consumers’ surplus would decrease The emerging incompatibilities would be a huge headache for both independent applications writers and corporate IT departments Such incompatibilities would also hurt shareholders, since the combined value of the resulting Baby Bills will be smaller than that of the original Microsoft  Another remedy proposal is auctioning the Windows source code Given the fluctuating stock market value of Microsoft, Windows source code may be worth as much as $200 billion No company can bid that much cash in an auction (Practically speaking, only a handful of foreign governments could) This implies that the source code of Windows would be sold forcibly at a small fraction of its worth – and that would                47 See Litan et al (2000) 48 See, among others, D’Aspremont et al (1979), Shaked and Sutton (1982), and Economides (1984) 49 See Economides and Flyer (1998), and Economides (2001)  33 severely reduce the value of shareholders’ equity Auctioning the Windows code would not only effectively confiscate Microsoft’s intellectual property, it would also seriously reduce the incentive for innovation not only for Microsoft but for all potential innovators Moreover, source code evolves Over time, different firms will add and alter the Windows code Soon, incompatibilities will arise, with all the negative consequences of diminution of network effects described earlier  A second remedy proposal would be to impose on Microsoft to disclose some of the so-called “APIs” (lines of software code that define interfaces between applications) that permit it to include Internet Explorer in the operating system Microsoft routinely discloses APIs that hook applications to the operating system and allow for interoperability Currently, it does not disclose APIs that tie together parts of the Windows operating system, which includes Internet Explorer If Microsoft were to disclose the APIs that hook Internet Explorer to other parts of the operating system, Netscape (or any other browser) could have the same interoperability with Windows 50 A third remedy proposal – and in my mind, the best -- would be to consider imposing various restrictions on the contracts that Microsoft can write with sellers of complementary goods and with competitors This is a likely remedy that is easy to tailor according to the violation This remedy – possibly combined with requiring Microsoft to disclose certain APIs -- should be sufficient to guarantee that Microsoft will be precluded from taking future anti-competitive actions At the same time, it would preserve the managerial and other benefits that have made Microsoft one of the most successful and most profitable companies ever  Some have proposed regulation of the operating systems part of Microsoft as a way to guarantee that there would be no leverage of market power There are very significant reasons to avoid regulation at this stage First, regulation is inappropriate for an industry that evolves quickly Regulation requires a stable product For example, regulation of AT T did not occur until 35 years had passed after the invention of the telephone, despite the fact that (i) telecommunications had much stronger network effects than software and (ii) during its first 40 years, AT T took much more aggressive actions than Microsoft, including refusal to deal and refusal to interconnect with competitors Second, regulation could stagnate innovation Third, in an industry with fast technical progress, regulation can be used by the regulated companies to keep prices high, as exemplified by telecommunications regulation  13 Concluding Remarks The immediate future of the Microsoft case brings the appeals process (at the DC Circuit Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court) well into the presidency of George W Bush It is almost certain that the appeals court will reverse the tying decision and will find Microsoft not liable on tying In my opinion, it is likely that the major parts of the                50 This is a disclosure of a few APIs that hook IE to Windows It does not imply a disclosure of a large number of APIs, which would be almost equivalent to disclosure of the Windows source code  34 rest of the District Court’s decision would also be reversed And, it is most likely that the federal part of the case will be settled after the Court of Appeals decision Microsoft will have very significant legal fees and related costs, as it also faces a large number of civil antitrust suits by class action plaintiffs The breakup would be disastrous, but, in my opinion, is extremely unlikely to be upheld The biggest loss to Microsoft is the continuous antitrust scrutiny that does not allow it to make significant acquisitions in telecommunications and the Internet in the United States during the period of intense antitrust scrutiny  The antitrust trial has put a tremendous pressure on Microsoft If the company was not controlled by Bill Gates and employees, it is very likely that, in the short-term interest of the shareholders, Microsoft would have compromised with DOJ, even though this is likely to have harmed the long-term interests of shareholders As things stand in August 2000, the stock price of Microsoft is down about 40 percent because of the continuing antitrust uncertainty  Regardless of the final outcome, the effects of U S v Microsoft are likely to be felt for a long time If a breakup actually occurs, it is likely to impose the dark shadow of radical antitrust intervention on the whole computer industry There are many firms in the computer sector that have a dominant position in their respective markets I would expect, if on appeal DOJ wins big on Microsoft and if DOJ takes a principled approach, antitrust suits against Yahoo, AOL, and other pioneers of the New Economy will not be far behind   35 14 Bibliography Amicus Curiae Brief Of Professor Lawrence Lessig, United States v Microsoft, Civil Action No 98-1232 (TPJ)  Areeda, Phillip and Louis Kaplow (1997),

Antitrust Standing Analysis Roger D Blair Jeffrey L Harrison Introduction The Supreme Court's 1977 decision in Illinois Brick Co v Illinois' was one of several opinions of that era that defined, and ultimately limited, the scope of private enforcement of the antitrust laws 2 In Illinois Brick, the Court held that indirect purchasers of goods and services from firms engaged in price fixing may not pursue antitrust actions for damages against those firms engaged in the price fixing 3 The Court's holding in Illinois Brick seemed to rest on three complementary rationales First, suits by indirect purchasers would be too unwieldy because each downstream purchaser would attempt to show the level of damage it suffered as a result of a remote price-fixing scheme 4 Second, the Court decided that deterrence, rather than compensation, was the primary purpose of antitrust damages Thus, they allowed direct purchasers to collect the full amount of the overcharge, even if this exceeded the actual harm suffered by that purchaser 5 Finally, because the Court already had barred the use of the pass-on defense in Hanover Shoe, Inc v United Shoe Machinery Corp , the Illinois Brick Court reasoned that it would have to either reverse Hanover Shoe or prohibit the offensive use of the pass-on theory to avoid multiple liability 6 It opted for the latter 7 Consequently, direct purchasers can collect all overcharges even if those firms have passed a portion of the overcharge on to indirect purchasers 8 Scholars roundly debated the issue of indirect Huber Hurst Professor of Economics, The University of Florida  Chesterfield Smith Professor of Law, The University of Florida We would like to thank the Warrington College of Business Administration and the College of Law at the University of Florida for financial support We also appreciate the research efforts of William Shilling and David Cayse 1 431 U S 720 (1977) 2 As a matter of substantive antitrust law, Continental TV , Inc v GTE Sylvania, Inc , 433 U S 36 (1977), is the best known case having this effect Procedurally, private antitrust enforcement has been tightened most notably by Matsushita Electric Industrial Co v Zenith Radio Corp , 475 U S 574 (1986) 3 See Illinois Brick, 431 U S at 720 This description narrowly states the holding Because the case actually involved price fixing, this statement is technically accurate, but it is probably also true that Illinois Brick bars recovery to any indirect plaintiff that seeks a measure of damages equal to a price overcharge For example, Hanover Shoe, Inc v United Shoe Machinery Corp , 392 U S 481 (1968), which prohibited a defense that plaintiffs had passed on a portion of the overcharge that they were claiming as damages, was a monopolization case 4 See Illinois Brick, 431 U S at 745 5 See id at 746 6 See id at 736 7 See id 8 See id at 735 December 1999 Vol 68 No 1 The George Washington Law Review purchaser \"standing\" 9 at the time of the Illinois Brick decision,10 but the Court's position complemented its prior holding in Hanover Shoe, which precluded defendants from lowering damages by demonstrating that direct purchasers had passed part of the overcharge on to their own customers \" Illinois Brick continues to require periodic interpretations by the Supreme Court 12 and lower courts 3 to refine what is meant by an indirect purchaser and to define possible exceptions ' 4 If viewed in the context of the simplest of price-fixing cases, and assuming that antitrust law is solely a matter for federal regulation, Illinois Brick makes good sense To continue assessing Illinois Brick by reference to how it works in the bare-bones price-fixing context, however, is too narrow a view First, the holding itself has not been confined to price-fixing cases ' 5 Second, and more importantly, since Illinois Brick the Supreme Court has developed a theory of antitrust standing which focuses on how remote a victim is relative to the anticompetitive action ' 6 A more fully developed notion of antitrust standing may render Illinois Brick expendable ' 7 Third, the Supreme Court has ruled that states may enact statutes which allow indirect purchasers to recover ' 8 As antitrust laws differ from state to state, the level of a defendant's exposure may be a function of geography rather than the extent of the competitive harm caused Consequently, the level of deterrence varies just as fortuitously Finally, the characterization of a case through imaginative pleading may enable a plaintiff to escape the limitation of Illinois Brick even 9 Although Illinois Brick is ultimately about \"standing\" in a general sense, the Supreme Court, since that decision, has developed the concept of \"antitrust standing \" See

America Corp , 59 ANTITRusT L J 273 (1990) [Vol 68 1 1999] Reexamining the Role of Illinois Brick 3 when it would appear to apply 19 Because of these factors, it has become difficult to square Illinois Brick with a consistent and predictable scheme of antitrust enforcement This Article argues that it is time for either the Court or Congress to reexamine Illinois Brick for the purpose of reconciling it with more general principles of antitrust standing The overall goals of such an endeavor would be to ensure consistent treatment of similarly situated potential plaintiffs and to rationalize private antitrust enforcement Section II briefly reviews the history of Illinois Brick and Section III examines the relevant post-Illinois Brick developments This discussion suggests that Illinois Brick is a product of antitrust happenstance and is sometimes applied inconsistently with its underlying rationales or with modem antitrust standing theory Section III also recognizes that Illinois Brick's application can vary from circuit to circuit For example, in some circuits, Illinois Brick seems to be used to determine the type of damage measure that can be employed in other circuits, it seems to be a more general standard for what kinds of plaintiffs may recover 20 Perhaps more importantly, Illinois Brick, although intended to make antitrust damage determination more manageable, actually forces plaintiffs into damage proofs that are more complex than basic overcharge calculations 21 This examination sets the stage for Section IV, which analyzes a number of possible solutions to problems surrounding Illinois Brick One solution would be to overturn both Illinois Brick and Hanover Shoe, thereby leaving the indirect purchaser issue to standard antitrust standing analysis Overturning these two decisions may seem to raise some of the complexities that Illinois Brick sought to avoid, but this Article suggests that these complexities have been overstated, at least relative to typical damage calculations Another solution would be to change the type of damages routinely granted in price-fixing cases Adopting lost profits as the appropriate measure of damages for all plaintiffs would eliminate some of the problems Illinois Brick sought to address Finally, a more modest response would be to redefine the limits of Illinois Brick in order to create greater consistency in the lower courts The objective of this approach would be to clarify whether Illinois Brick determines the acceptable measure of damages in particular cases or whether it determines the types of plaintiffs who may recover damages Admittedly, none of these solutions is entirely satisfactory, but flexibility and the consequent lack of predictability seem endemic to what is essentially \"common law \" Nevertheless, each of these proposals has the potential to increase the consistency of private enforcement 19 For example, price fixing could also be characterized as a boycott, thus escaping Illinois Brick's limitation on price-fixing suits by indirect purchasers See In re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litig , 123 F 3d 599, 606 (7th Cir 1997) 20 See infra text accompanying notes 154-211 21 See infra text accompanying notes 167-170 The George Washington Law Review I The Evolution of Illinois Brick A Early History One can glean a greater understanding of Illinois Brick's awkward fit in current antitrust law by examining the decision's genesis The issues of who and how much one may recover in an antitrust action arise from section 4 of the Clayton Act, the pertinent parts of which provide that \"[a]ny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws  shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained \"22 Of course, antitrust scholars now know that \"any person\" really means \"some persons\" and that \"damages  sustained\" is hardly subject to concrete definition 1 The \"Reasonable Certainty\" Standard Part of the explanation for the rule of Illinois Brick can be traced to the efforts by courts, soon after passage of the Sherman Act, to continue to apply common law notions of when one was entitled to damages One of the more important rules for the recovery of damages was that the amount of damage must be shown with \"reasonable certainty \" 23 An early example of this proposition was Central Coal Coke Co v Hartman,24 in which the plaintiff, once a participant in a price-fixing \"coal club\" of coal wholesalers, withdrew from the club only to find that the remaining members would not sell him coal at any price other than the fixed price available to consumers 2- The plaintiff could have claimed that he was the victim of a boycott or price fixing Additionally, in theory, damages could have been defined in terms of lost profits or the overcharge The Eighth Circuit rejected the plaintiff's damage claim for lost profits and applied reasoning common in that era in contract damages claims \"expected profits of a commercial business are too remote, speculative, and uncertain to warrant a judgment for their loss \"'26 The attitude courts took toward antitrust claims gradually changed Courts seemed to be swayed by the notion that a rigid approach to damages permitted \"wrong-doers\" to escape the consequences of their actions Perhaps the best early example of this was Eastman Kodak Co v Southern Photo Materials Co 27 The plaintiff, Southern Photo, purchased photographic 22 15 U S C § 15(a) (1994) 23 See Central Coal Coke Co v Hartman, 111 F 96, 98 (8th Cir 1901) 24 Id at 96 25 See id at 97 The plaintiff could have described the conduct of the defendants as either price fixing or a group boycott-or both Although not an indirect purchaser, if the plaintiff had been, these options might have created an avenue for avoiding Illinois Brick See infra text accompanying notes 122-125 26 Central Coal, 111 F at 98 Although cited as an example of the difficulties of recovering lost profits, it is not clear that the plaintiff presented enough evidence to survive even a less exacting standard 27 273 U S 359, 379 (1927) Five years earlier in Keogh v Chicago Northwestern Railway Co , 260 U S 156 (1922), the Supreme Court also considered the standard to be applied in a lost profits case involving antitrust laws and reasoned that recovery could be allowed if damages were based on \"facts from which their existence is logically and legally inferable \" Keogh, 260 U S at 158 [Vol 68 1 Reexamining the Role of Illinois Brick supplies from Kodak and sold them to consumers 8 Southern Photo claimed that Kodak had violated antitrust laws by acquiring Southern Photo's competitors and refusing to make photographic supplies available to Southern Photo at prices reflecting a dealer's discount 29 Instead, Kodak charged Southern Photo the same prices it charged in its retail stores 30 The damage claim was for the profits lost due to Southern Photo's inability to buy Kodak's products at the discounted prices 31 In calculating damages, the plaintiff relied on a four-year period before the violation to estimate its lost sales and then subtracted its operating costs from the gross revenue it would have earned 32 The defendant, citing Hartman for the proposition that proof of loss must be shown with reasonable certainty, argued that the damages were \"purely speculative '33 The Supreme Court agreed with the Fifth Circuit that \"'[d]amages are not rendered uncertain because they cannot be calculated with absolute exactness It is sufficient if a reasonable basis of computation is afforded, although the result be only approximate \"' 34 The rationale for this approach was that \"a defendant whose wrongful conduct has rendered difficult the ascertainment of the precise damages suffered  is not entitled to complain that they cannot be measured with the same exactness and precision as would otherwise be possible ''as This, of course, makes sense because the wrongdoer has created the need for estimation and the resulting uncertainty A more liberal view is found in 1946 in Bigelow v RKO Radio Pictures, Inc ,36 in which exhibitors of motion pictures claimed that a conspiracy among other exhibitors and distributors denied them access to films The plaintiffs calculated damages based on lost profits caused by their competitive disadvantage relative to other theaters that had access to the films 37 The plaintiffs used two methods to calculate damages one involved a comparison of their profits with those of a competing theater involved in the conspiracy, and the other compared their profits before the conspiracy with profits after the conspiracy 38 In neither case did the plaintiffs account for any of the fac28 See Eastman Kodak Co , 273 U S at 368 29 See id at 368-69 30 See id at 369 31 See id 32 See id at 376 33 See ic at 376-78 For a modem analysis of

the proposition attributed to it by the Southern Photo Court is not obvious The Southern Photo Court describes the problem of permitting the wrong-doer to escape when he or she has rendered the determination of damages more difficult Hetzel, on the other hand, suggests merely that \"it does not come with very good grace [for a wrongdoer] to insist upon the most specific and certain proof  \"

have affected profits other than the discriminatory treatment 39 The Supreme Court, nonetheless, ruled that although a verdict may not be based on mere speculation, a jury may make a \"just and reasonable estimate '40 2 Acceptance of the Overcharge as the Proper Measure of Damages Although adherence to the common law requirement of \"reasonable certainty\" was relaxed, another equally important development also made it easier for some antitrust plaintiffs to recover This development was the acceptance of the overcharge as the standard measure of damages in pricefixing cases The overcharge equals the difference between the price paid and the price that would have prevailed \"but for\" the violation The Supreme Court apparently first accepted and applied the overcharge measure of damages in Chattanooga Foundry Pipe Works v City of Atlanta 41 In this 1906 case, the City of Atlanta purchased cast iron water pipe for its municipal waterworks from a seller engaged in price fixing 42 The \"damages\" could hardly be expressed in terms of lost profits because a municipal waterworks does not earn profits The Court permitted recovery for \"the difference between the price paid and the market or fair price\" 43 of the pipe, that is, the difference between the price paid and the price in the absence of the conspiracy Accordingly, \"[the city] was injured in its property, at least, if not in its business of furnishing water, by being led to pay more than the worth of the pipe \"44 The illegal overcharge measure of damages was clearly the appropriate measure of damages in Chattanooga Foundry In a not-for-profit undertaking, the cost of providing the service above the cost at which it could have been provided is the actual loss to the provider In other contexts, however, the overcharge measure does not match up with any conventional measure of damages 45 The actual harm suffered by the buyer is the profit lost as a result of the overcharge 46 It is this amount-not the overcharge-that accurately trust damage calculation See Roger D Blair Amanda Kay Esquibel, Yardstick Damages in Lost Profit Cases An Econometric Approach, 72 DNv U L Rnv 113 (1994)

price If so, the party will experience a decreased profit on each unit sold If the party chooses to continue to sell the same quantity, the lost profit and overcharge are the same, but this is an unlikely strategy Second, the party can attempt to pass the full price increase on to its customers As prices rise, customers will demand fewer units, and the profit that was made on those units will be lost Third, if the party is a seller it can, and typically does, raise the price, but not by the full amount of the overcharge The seller, therefore, loses [Vol 68 1 Reexamining the Role of Illinois Brick compensates the buyer 47 Moreover, the overcharge is not even equal to the unjust enrichment of the price fixers 48 Consequently, following Chattanooga Foundry, courts could have restricted the overcharge measure to cases in which plaintiffs were not attempting to earn a profit and required all other plaintiffs to seek actual compensatory damages This did not occur and both for-profit and not-forprofit price-fixing victims alike sought the overcharge measure of damages The availability of this measure of damages was heightened, in part, because of a line of cases decided during the same period concerning the rates charged by railroads in excess of what the Interstate Commerce Commission deemed reasonable In the leading case, Southern Pacific Co v DarnellTaenzer Lumber Co ,49 shippers asked for reparations equal to the overcharge while the defendant railroads argued that the shippers had passed the overcharge on to their customers 50 In rejecting this form of the \"pass on\" defense, Justice Holmes stated that \"[t]he general tendency of the law, in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the first step ''51 The reasoning, he suggested, was that the legal claim accrued at the time the overcharge occurred and that the law \"does not inquire into later events 52 Not only was the overcharge measure available to for-profit and not-forprofit plaintiffs, it also was not limited to conventional price-fixing cases Especially in the period between Chattanooga Foundry and Southern Photo, it was beneficial for any plaintiff to express its damages in terms of an overcharge For example, Straus v Victor Talking Machine Co ,53 a 1924 case, seems to fit the fact pattern of what would be viewed, in modern times, as a \"terminated dealer\" case 54 Macy's, a dealer in Victor's original distribution system, purchased Victor products and resold them to the public 55 Victor decided to convert its former dealers into sales agents Under this arrangement, the former dealers did not actually purchase and resell Victor prodsome profit on the units it continues to sell, and it also loses profits on sales lost as a result of the price increase 47 It is worthwhile to note that this analysis presupposes the typical model of price fixing by sellers Price fixing by buyers is also commonplace-for example, bid rigging at auctions-in which case, the measure would be in terms of an \"undercharge \" For a detailed analysis of monopsony, see ROGER D BLAIR JEFFREY L HARRISON, MONOPsONY ANTITRUST LAW AND ECONOMICS (1994) 48 The overcharge to the victim is equal to the quantity purchased multiplied by the difference between the price paid and the price that would have been paid in the absence of the price fixing This is not equal to the net benefit to the price-fixing firms Basic economic theory indicates that an increase in price will result in fewer units being sold Thus, although the pricefixing firms receive the overcharge, it is offset to some degree by the loss in revenue from sales forgone 49 245 U S 531 (1918) 50 See id at 533 51 Id 52 Id at 534 Precisely where the duty to mitigate damages would fall into this formulation is not clear See Amanda Kay Esquibel, The Rule of Avoidable Consequences in Antitrust Cases A Law and Economics Approach, 26 HoFsTRA L Rsv 891, 911 (1998) 53 297 F 791 (2d Cir 1924) 54 See E THOMAS

5 6 Because Macy's refused to enter into the new arrangement, Victor refused to provide additional products 57 Macy's remained in the retail market by obtaining Victor products through other sources, although not at the discounted price it would have enjoyed had it not been terminated as a dealer 58 The Second Circuit noted that \"[t]he constant tendency of the courts is to find some way in which damages can be awarded where a wrong has been done '59 The court further noted that, historically, plaintiffs claiming damages equal to lost profits frequently failed to recover because they could not meet the \"reasonable certainty\" requirement 60 In Straus, the plaintiff attempted to avoid that problem by asking for damages equal to the difference between the price it had paid for the products after termination, and the price it would have paid had it not been terminated 61 In permitting what was, in effect, an overcharge theory, the court essentially accepted a justification based on proximate cause As in Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co ,62 from which the Court quoted, the notion seemed to be that the harm initially suffered by the plaintiff was the increase in price 63 Thus, according to the Second Circuit, plaintiffs \"contend  for a rule of damage which seeks the proximate cause of damage and the proximate result occasioned by that cause \" 64 By the 1940s, efforts to reconcile the antitrust damage provisions with the common law requirement that lost profits be proven with \"reasonable certainty\" led to two outcomes (1) the routine measure of damages in pricefixing cases was the overcharge and (2) the standard of certainty for the amount of damages in all antitrust cases was relaxed 65 It is noteworthy that only the second step was necessary for the antitrust laws to overcome the \"reasonable certainty\" hurdle of the common law Having taken that step, courts could have required all plaintiffs to estimate actual damages as reflected in reduced profits In one line of cases-those dealing with price dis-\" crimination-this adjustment has occurred 66 Otherwise, both of these accommodations to the problem of proving damages continue to exist Therefore, depending on the alleged violation, a plaintiff may recover either actual losses or an amount that is likely to be greatly in excess of actual losses This creates an obvious imbalance in the incentives to bring private actions 56 See Straus, 297 F at 794 The purpose of the change was to enable Victor to control the resale price of its products This was a result of Dr Miles Medical Co v John D Park Sons, 220

that victims of anticompetitive behavior did not go uncompensated have actually limited the extent to which some of those harmed can recover This outcome can be traced directly to the use of the overcharge measure of damages, and the Supreme Court's decision in Hanover Shoe, Inc v United Shoe Machinery Corp 67 Hanover Shoe was a private action in the aftermath of the well-known U S Justice Department action challenging United Shoe's practice of making its shoe manufacturing machinery available on a lease-only basis 68 Rather than asking for damages equal to lost profits, Hanover Shoe framed its damage claim in terms of an illegal overcharge 69 The trial court reasoned that Hanover Shoe would have purchased the machines, if permitted to do so, at a lower cost than the cost of the leases 7 ° United Shoe challenged this measure of damages by arguing that Hanover Shoe had passed the overcharge on to its own customers and, thus, suffered no injury 71 The Court rejected this so-called \"pass-on\" defense 7 2 First, the Court reasoned that recognizing such a defense would render antitrust cases far more complicated 73 Second, the Court feared that those who ultimately absorbed the overcharge-the consumerswould have so little at stake in the outcome of an antitrust action that a violation might go unchallenged 7 4 67 392 U S 481 (1968) 68 See United States v United

clear that the Hanover Shoe Court understood the difference between the overcharge measure of damages and lost profits For example, at one point Justice White, for the Court, reasons that [i]f in the face of the overcharge the buyer does nothing and absorbs the loss, he is entitled to treble damages  The reason is that he has paid more than he should and his property has been illegally diminished, for had the price paid been lower his profits would have been higher Id at 489 Similarly, \"[a]s long as the seller continues to charge the illegal price, he takes from the buyer more than the law allows At whatever price the buyer sells, the price he pays the seller remains illegally high, and his profits would be greater were his costs lower \" Id Perhaps the reasoning of the Court was that even if the buyer passes on the overcharge, there will be a lower profit As a matter of economic theory, that is almost always the case Furthermore, if profits are lower, the damage requirement of section 4 is arguably fulfilled The measure of damages, however, is the overcharge The problem with this analysis is that section 4 specifically calls for \"threefold the damages  sustained \" 15 U S C § 15(a) (1994) (emphasis added) 1999] The George Washington Law Review Illinois Brick addressed an issue complementary to that addressed in Hanover Shoe As in Chattanooga Foundry, Illinois Brick involved purchases by a governmental entity 75 In this case, the State of Illinois claimed that it had made purchases from contractors who were customers of price-fixing manufacturers of concrete blocks 76 The issue was whether these \"indirect purchasers\" could collect damages under section 4 of the Clayton Act 77 Although the plaintiffs urged the Court to limit Hanover Shoe to cases in which capital goods were the price-fixed goods, the Court adopted the view that ruling in favor of indirect purchasers would require overruling Hanover Shoe 78 The Court reasoned that permitting the offensive use of a pass-on theory while not permitting a pass-on defense would subject defendants to multiple liability 7 9 In addition, the basic rationale-the complexity of sorting out the incidence of the overcharge-was no less compelling in the context of indirect purchasers 80 Having decided that the pass-on theory would have to apply equally to both plaintiffs and defendants, the Court held that there could be no offensive use of the theory 8' In so doing, the Court reasoned that \"the use of the pass-on theories\" would result in \"massive efforts to apportion the recovery among all potential plaintiffs that could have absorbed part of the overcharge  ,82 These complications would follow from efforts to determine the extent of the damage at each level of the chain of distribution 83 The complexity would not be overcome by the possibility that all potential plaintiffs could be joined In rejecting the practicality of apportioning a fixed amount of overcharge, the Court accepted the notion that, in theory, portions of the overcharge could be assigned to each level in the chain of distribution by knowing the elasticity of demand and supply at each level 84 But, to the Court, the theory did not translate into sound antitrust policy 85 Related to the apportionment problem was the Court's view that, under a pass-on system, each plaintiff would incur greater costs in proving damages 75 See Illinois Brick, 431 U S at 726 76 See id at 726-27 77 See id At the time, there was a division among the circuit courts on this issue Compare Mangano v American Radiator Standard

Reexamining the Role of Illinois Brick and the net recovery for direct and indirect purchasers would decline 86 This would \"seriously impair this important weapon of antitrust enforcement \" 87 The Court recognized that rejection of the pass-on theory would mean that indirect victims of anticompetitive acts would go uncompensated 88 It also noted the likelihood that some direct purchasers would decline to bring an action against suppliers to avoid risking a disruption in their relationship with those suppliers 89 Still, in balancing the costs and benefits of permitting use of pass-on arguments, the Court found greater deterrence to be a more important goal than more accurate compensation 90 It is useful to focus on several important aspects of Illinois Brick For one thing, the decision accepts in a very broad sense the imprecision of the gross overcharge measure of damages It is imprecise not simply because some portion of the overcharge is passed on, but because the overcharge always has been regarded as a measure of the defendant's gain as opposed to the plaintiff's loss (or damage) 91 In addition, there is very little to suggest that the rationale of Illinois Brick is to be extended beyond cases involving damages calculated as overcharges This is important because the general notion that the proof of damages is complex is accurate in a great many instances and Illinois Brick left open the issue whether the complexity rationale might be extended to define a more general concept of antitrust standing II Post-Illinois Brick Developments Almost immediately after Illinois Brick, events began to unfold that seemed to undo whatever rationalizing effect the decision had One of these events was the Supreme Court's approval of indirect purchaser actions under state antitrust laws 92 Another was an extremely broad interpretation of Illinois Brick and a narrow interpretation of its exceptions 93 The most important event has been the development of a comprehensive approach to antitrust standing 94 Finally, a number of lower court opinions have interpreted Illinois Brick in inconsistent ways 95 A State Indirect Purchaser Actions One of the most significant events, and one having a severe derationalizing effect on antitrust enforcement, occurred in 1989 when several states brought actions similar to that in Illinois Brick In California v ARC

America's implications, see Ron1999] The George Washington Law Review ers of cement 97 Their actions were filed not only under federal antitrust law, but under state antitrust laws that permitted indirect purchasers to recover 98 The issue before the Court was whether its decisions in Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick preempted state laws permitting indirect purchasers to recover 99 In an awkwardly reasoned opinion, the Court set out basic preemption doctrine, indicating that preemption could occur in this type of case100 only if Congress intended to occupy the field or, in instances in which Congress has not occupied the field, if the state law \"actually conflicts with federal law \" 101 At its most basic level, the case for preemption came down to whether allowing indirect purchasers to recover under state law would undermine the policies underlying Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick The Court considered three policies The first \"policy\" was one of avoiding complicated procedures 102 The Court noted that recognition of indirect purchasers would not necessarily complicate matters in federal courts 1°3 Not only were state antitrust issues likely to be addressed by state courts, but if a federal court were asked to consider the state claim under pendant jurisdiction, the court could decline ' 04 The second \"policy\" was not diluting the incentives of potential plaintiffs '05 On this issue, the Court reasoned that there would be no decreased incentive for direct purchasers to bring actions under federal antitrust laws 106 The third and most difficult \"policy\" of Illinois Brick that the Court addressed was the avoidance of multiple liability 107 The Court's reasoning on this point is far from convincing In a conclusory fashion, it simply explained that in \"none of [the previous direct purchaser and standing cases] did the Court identify a federal policy against States imposing liability in addition to that imposed by federal law \"' 08 This reasoning actually may be consistent with preemption doctrine, but it is inconsistent with a fair reading of the aid W Davis, Indirect Purchaser Litigation ARC America's Chickens Come Home to

result in \"duplicative recoveries\" and \"unwarranted multiple liability \"'10 9 The importance of ARC America can best be understood by focusing on the possibility that there may be an efficient level of anticompetitive activity as well as an efficient level of enforcement Although the notion of an efficient level of anticompetitive activity may seem rather odd, it is important to remember that the line separating antitrust violations from lawful activities often is not a bright one Thus, a firm engaging in conduct that has not been adjudicated under antitrust law risks exposure to treble damages Moreover, the activity itself may not be the key source of uncertainty Many arguably anticompetitive actions, whether assessed under section 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act, will not violate antitrust laws unless the firm possesses market power \" 0 The concept of market power, however, can be slippery Notwithstanding the judicial tradition of inferring market power from market share, market power is only partially related to the firm's market share ' Not only is the requisite level of market power difficult to determine in an absolute sense, it may be that the level of market power needed to establish an antitrust violation differs with the activity involved \"? Even this understates the risk When a business practice or market structure is actually litigated, the question of market power becomes an issue for a relatively unsophisticated jury to decide All of these factors may make it seem futile to discuss seriously the \"efficient\" level of enforcement and the \"efficient\" level of risky and, possibly, illegal behavior Regardless of how one feels about the practicality of having useful debates on these matters before ARC America, the decision to permit plaintiffs to press indirect purchaser actions under state law means that a firm is, for all

United, Inc 11 4 In Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick, the Supreme Court left open two possible ways for indirect purchasers to recover The first is when the indirect purchaser has a preexisting cost-plus contract with the direct purchaser 115 The second possibility arises when the direct purchaser is owned or controlled by the firm fixing prices 116 Together, these exceptions suggest that indirect purchasers would have federal standing when the difficulties of apportioning the overcharge among groups would be minimal and when the direct purchaser has little motivation to bring an action The Court's 1990 decision in Kansas v Utilicorp United, Inc all but extinguished the possibility of a policy-based determination of other exceptions to Illinois Brick In that case, the indirect purchasers were residents of Kansas and Missouri\" 7 who claimed that they had purchased natural gas from various utilities at inflated prices \" 8 The prices were inflated, the indirect purchaser insisted, because a pipeline and a group of gas production companies were fixing prices 119 The direct purchaser was the utility serving customers in Kansas and Missouri 120 The defendants claimed the utility lacked standing because it passed the entire overcharge on to consumers under the rates filed with the relevant regulatory agencies 121 The District Court held that the utilities had standing while the consumers did not 122 In a five-to-four opinion,' 23 the Court affirmed the lower court In so doing, the Court responded to the argument that the utilities had what was, in effect, a cost-plus contract with the consumers in which the overcharges 114 497 U S 199 (1990) For additional reading on the use of indirect purchasers, see Robert Elkin Robert J Bluhm, Indirect Purchaser

Utilicorp, 497 U S at 206 [Vol 68 1 Reexamining the Role of Illinois Brick appeared as part of the rate filed with the state regulatory agencies 124 The states conceded that even a fully passed-through overcharge would result in some damage to the utility as consumers decreased purchases in response to higher prices 125 Nevertheless, the states argued that the full overcharge on the quantity sold was passed on to the consumers and the apportionment problem, which Illinois Brick sought to avoid, did not exist 26 In response, the majority of the Court noted that the utility could be injured in ways other than a loss of business 27 Specifically, to determine whether the direct purchaser-the utility-suffered any damage, one would have to know whether that purchaser could have raised prices ' 28 If a direct purchaser could have, and then does, raise prices in response to a cost increase associated with price fixing, then the price fixing harms the direct purchaser by inhibiting its ability to raise prices for its own benefit 129 The Court also noted that a cost increase might not result in an instant increase in consumer prices, which also would complicate the apportionment problem 130 In effect, the apportionment process in a regulated context was unlikely to be any less complicated than in an unregulated context The Court also noted that any recovery granted to the utility may have to be passed on to consumers 13' This, according to the Court, meant that the indirect purchasers may be compensated independent of their own action for damages 32 The Court then attempted to address a problem that its own analysis seemed to create If utilities were likely to be required to pass on to consumers any antitrust recovery, what incentive would the utility have to bring an action in the first place? The Court reasoned that the utility would have to be aggressive about pressing its claim because it could not be sure that it could pass the overcharge on to its customers 133 Moreover, the Court noted that utilities historically had been aggressive in the enforcement of antitrust laws 1 3 4 It is much easier to see Utilicorp as driven by policy as opposed to reason or even straight-forward precedent The type of apportionment the Court 124 See Utilicorp, 497 U S at 217 125 See id at 209 126 See id at 208 127 See id at 209 128 See id 129 See id 130 See id at 210 131 See id at 212 132 See id at 211-12 This raises a rather obvious question Why would the utility bother suing if it could not retain any of the award? 133 See id at 214 This is somewhat curious reasoning because the overcharge already had been passed on to the consumers 134 See id at 215 The dissenting opinion, written by Justice White, took issue with virtually every aspect of the majority's reasoning For example, Justice White wrote that it seemed \"fanciful\" to think the utility was not charging rates as high as the state would allow Id at 222 (White, J , dissenting) Therefore, the rate increase could be traced directly and fully to the overcharge See id (White, J , dissenting) The dissent also noted that the \"difficult\" apportioning problem identified by the majority was a common exercise in other types of antitrust actions See id at 223 (White, J , dissenting) 1999] The George Washington Law Review seemed to fear is certainly less complicated than that found in many private actions for damages In addition, the notion that the utility charges less than regulatory officials would allow seems less likely than the opposite assumption The general impression the opinion leaves is not that the Court has engaged in successful reasoning, but that it has set out a number of assumptions under which its holding could be reconciled with Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick 135 Thus, what Utilicorp seems to stand for most clearly is a narrowing of the scope of antitrust plaintiffs and a broad disfavoring of actions by those who are arguably \"indirectly\" affected C Supreme Court Development of Antitrust Standing Soon after its decision in Illinois Brick, the Court decided a series of cases that addressed issues raised in its wake In its decisions in Blue Shield v McCready136 in 1982, and Associated General Contractors, Inc v California State Council, Inc 37 (\"AGC\") a year later, the Supreme Court began to articulate the basic elements of \"antitrust standing '138 More specifically, the Court addressed the issue of how to properly interpret the language of section 4 of the Clayton Act, which permits recovery by \"any person who shall be injured ' 139 The Court described this as an inquiry that was \"analytically distinct\"'140 from that presented in Illinois Brick 141 In AGC, the more important of these two cases, 142 the Court developed a multipart test First, the plaintiff must have suffered antitrust injury 143 Second, a court must weigh three factors including the remoteness of the injury,144 the existence of a potential plaintiff with a greater motivation to 135 In this respect, it reminds one of the \"rational relationship\" test found in equal protection analysis 136 457 U S 465 (1982) 137 459 U S 519 (1983) 138 The Court previously had addressed the issue in a more general context in Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc v Camp, 397 U S 150 (1970), and concluded that a plaintiff had standing if there was injury in fact and the interest to be protected is \"arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question \" Camp, 397 U S at 153 For a good survey of antitrust standing decisions prior to 1980, see Comment, Standing to Sue in Antitrust Cases The Offensive Use of Passing-On, 123 U PA L REv 976 (1975) 139 McCready, 457 U S at 472 140 Id at 476 141 This was, in fact, a question that had been addressed by lower courts for years 142 The facts of McCready are found in the text accompanying notes 248-249, infra 143 See Associated Gen Contractors, Inc v California State Council, Inc , 459 U S 519, 540 (1983) In a separate but related line of cases, the Court had developed the notion of \"antitrust injury \" In effect, the injured party must complain of the type of injury that the antitrust laws were designed to protect against See Brunswick Corp v Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc , 429 U S 477, 489 (1977) See generally Roger D Blair Jeffrey L Harrison, Rethinking Antitrust Injury, 42 VAND L REv 1539 (1989) Page, supra note 113 144 See Associated Gen Contractors, Inc v California State Council, Inc , 459 U S at 540 [Vol 68 1 Reexamining the Role of Illinois Brick bring an action,145 and the complexity of the ensuing litigation should a particular plaintiff be permitted to bring an action 146 Although Illinois Brick is viewed as analytically distinct from the AGC test and is expressly invoked to support only the last of these three factors, it is hard not to see the policies of Illinois Brick throughout AGC 147 For example, Illinois Brick stressed not just the complexity issue, but also the problem of deterrence 14 Indeed, the closeness of the opinions might best be assessed by asking what the analysis in Illinois Brick might have looked like had it been issued after AGC's more general standing guidelines had been established Almost certainly, the Court would have regarded Illinois Brick as an ordinary standing case and noted the remoteness of indirect purchasers, the complexity of the damage calculation, and the presence of potential plaintiffs-the masons who purchased the concrete blocks directly from the manufacturers-who would be motivated to bring an action 149 Given that the Court did not fold Illinois Brick into a general antitrust standing analysis, it left open a number of possible interpretations of Illinois Brick First, Illinois Brick could have simply stood for the definition of damages Under this interpretation, Illinois Brick would have answered the question, \"what is the appropriate measure of damages in price-fixing cases?\"'150 Measure is emphasized because the decision does not adopt actual harm as the measure of damages, but adopts a surrogate-the full overcharge Second, Illinois Brick also could have been seen as a per se application of AGC As with its substantive antitrust law counterparts, it could have been viewed as standing for the proposition that when a plaintiff is an indirect purchaser, the step-by-step analysis of AGC can be dispensed with because indirect purchasers almost always will fail the standing test This appears to be the position that Illinois Brick now represents Third, as will be discussed in greater detail below, Illinois Brick could have been interpreted in a way that would have assisted in rationalizing the system of antitrust plaintiffs and deterrence Under this interpretation, it is not obvious that every indirect purchaser would be denied standing For example, in Illinois Brick itself, the Court concedes that some direct purchasers 145 See id at 542 This issue could be put in terms of whether a violation would go undetected should a specific plaintiff be denied standing 146 See id at 543-44 The Court cited Illinois Brick as supporting the last of these factors See id at 545 147 It may be important in this regard to distinguish between antitrust injury, which is now part of an antitrust standing analysis, and being an indirect purchaser Plaintiffs who fail the standing test because they have not suffered an antitrust injury have not incurred the types of harm that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent Even if they have suffered antitrust injury and have cleared the other hurdles as well, as indirect purchasers they are still disqualified 148 See Illinois Brick Co v Illinois, 431 U S 720, 745 (1977) 149 It seems likely that indirect purchasers would satisfy the antitrust injury part of the test as the overcharge eventually passed on to them, which is certainly the type of harm the antitrust laws were designed to prevent 150 At least one court has suggested that Illinois Brick-type plaintiffs may still be eligible for a recovery if they recharacterize the offense as something other than price fixing See In re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litig , 123 F 3d 599, 606 (7th Cir 1997) 1999] The George Washington Law Review may not be motivated to bring an antitrust action against a supplier 151 In addition, there are cases beyond those involving preexisting cost-plus contracts in which the determination of the damages would not be unduly complicated As with so much of the happenstance that seems to explain Illinois Brick, the fact that it preceded McCready and AGC by a few years may have been critical in its result More directly, it is not clear that the application of antitrust standing principles developed after Illinois Brick would have resulted in what is essentially a per se approach to barring actions by indirect purchasers Instead, the Court may have opted for a case-by-case analysis that applies the policies152 of AGC to each set of indirect purchasers Indeed, under standing doctrine, as opposed to Illinois Brick, the indirect purchasers in Utilicorp may have fared differently Moreover, as will be discussed below, Illinois Brick, as applied, seems to block certain types of plaintiffs who are not more remotely affected than other plaintiffs who do have standing 15D Expanding and Contracting Illinois Brick Even though it is, in effect, a per se standing rule, it is not clear how broadly Illinois Brick is intended to apply More specifically, can it block actions by plaintiffs who, though indirectly affected, might pass muster under conventional standing analysis? Also, can a plaintiff avoid Illinois Brick by taking care not to characterize its claim as price fixing? Both the elasticity and limitations of Illinois Brick have been demonstrated by five recent cases ' 54 These cases inform us, depending on one's point of view, of the potential dangers or promise of that opinion, and assist us in determining what might be done to bring Illinois Brick into a more coherent model of antitrust enforcement 1 Lucas Automotive Engineering v Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc Perhaps the simplest expression of a possible extension of Illinois Brick is found in Lucas Automotive Engineering, Inc v Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc ,'55 in which a distributor of vintage automobile tires challenged the acquisition by its competition of an exclusive license to manufacture Firestone vintage tires '56 The Ninth Circuit first applied an ordinary standing analysis, as discussed above, and determined that the plaintiff did not have standing, 151 See Illinois Brick, 431 U S at 746 (noting that purchasers might be concerned about \"disrupting relations with a supplier\") 152 See supra discussion accompanying notes 67-91 153 For a case that views AGC as controlling the application of Illinois Brick, see In re Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litigation, 998 F 2d 1144,

The plaintiff also argued that it was now in the position of a consumer because it would have to purchase some brands of tires from the competing distributor 158 The court observed that, since the acquisition, the plaintiff had not actually purchased tires from its rival, but had purchased them from a supplier who had, in turn, used the defendant as its supplier 59 In effect, the plaintiff was an indirect purchaser Noting that the fundamental basis for the holding in Illinois Brick was to avoid the problem of apportioning overcharges, 160 the court then held that the plaintiff could not bring an action for damages resulting from the licensing agreement 161 In effect, the fact that the substantive violation was not price fixing was of no consequence On the other hand, the fact that the plaintiff was indirectly affected did not bar an action by the plaintiff as an indirect purchaser for injunctive relief in the form of divestiture 162 2 In re Brand Name Prescription Drug Litigation Lucas Automotive is somewhat difficult, but not impossible, to square with the reasoning of Judge Posner in In re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litigation63 (\"BNPD\") In that case, retailers of brand name prescription drugs claimed that manufacturers and wholesalers had conspired with one another to deny retailers discounts available to favored customers, including HMOs and mail order pharmacies ' 64 The trial court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that a conspiracy existed between manufacturers and wholesalers, which meant that the wholesalers were direct purchasers from the manufacturers and the retailers were indirect purchasers 165 Despite this conclusion, however, the trial court went on to hold that the retailers fit within the \"control\" exception to Illinois Brick 66 The Seventh Circuit reversed both holdings, finding sufficient evidence for the plaintiffs to survive summary judgment on the issue of the existence of a conspiracy 67 Consequently, the exception to Illinois Brick, on which the lower court had relied and which Judge Posner found unpersuasive, was unnecessary Beyond that, however, Judge Posner opined that even if it were 157 See id at 1232-33 Specifically, the court reasoned that the plaintiff failed the \"antitrust injury\" element of the standing analysis See id at 1233 158 See id at 1233 159

id at 1234 162 See id at 1234-35 As a competitor, however, the plaintiff did not have standing to bring an action for divestiture 163 123 F 3d 599 (7th Cir 1997) 164 See id at 602-03 In the class action, the retailers pursued this as a price-fixing claim for damages See id- Another theory was a violation of the Robinson-Patman Act, which would have obviated the need for an Illinois Brick analysis See id at 604 165 See id at 604 166 See id at 605-06 167 See id at 616 1999] The George Washington Law Review found that the manufacturers and wholesalers had not conspired, Illinois Brick might not bar a recovery We can imagine the present case reconfigured in a way that might take it out of the orbit of [Illinois Brick and Hanover Shoe]  A number of pharmacies have tried to improve their bargaining position vis-a-vis the drug manufacturers by forming buying groups   The manufacturers have been steadfast in refusing to grant discounts to such groups If this refusal, taking as it does the form of a refusal to enter into direct contractual relations with certain retailers, such as the manufacturers have with their favored customers, were successfully challenged as a boycott the Illinois Brick rule, which is a rule concerning overcharges, would fall away The plaintiffs would be permitted to prove up whatever damages they could show had flowed from the boycott, provided they weren't seeking to recover overcharges, for that would entail the very incidence analysis that Illinois Brick bars 168 In many respects, Judge Posner's suggestion points out the inconsistency of Illinois Brick First, the plaintiffs would be required to rely on the boycott theory only if they were found to be indirect purchasers Then, presumably they would be required to demonstrate not the overcharge, but evidently the lost profits incurred due to the boycott Because the refusal to grant discounts was the basis of the claim and lost profits would have to flow from not being granted these discounts, a logical requirement for calculating damages would be to determine what the discounts would have been 169 In essence, Judge Posner falls prey to the practical fallacy inherent in Illinois Brick 170 the first step in determining the damages that Judge Posner suggests are available requires the plaintiffs to conduct a basic overcharge analysis Moreover, Judge Posner does not say that reshaping the theory of liability somehow transforms the plaintiffs into something other than indirect purchasers 171 Judge Posner's language can be contrasted with that of Judge O'Scannlain in Lucas Automotive According to Judge O'Scannlain, \"the Supreme Court has held that an indirect or remote purchaser lacks standing to seek damages relief against the manufacturer for alleged violations of federal antitrust laws \"'1 72 In effect, Judge O'Scannlain seems to view Illinois Brick as a standing opinion Judge Posner, in contrast, seems to view the application of Illinois Brick as connected specifically to one's theory of liability and measure of damages To grasp this inconsistency, one must consider how the outcomes of the two cases might have been different had the circuits 168 Id at 606 (internal citations omitted) 169 Estimating lost profits any other way would be very difficult because many variables would have to be considered 170 See discussion infra Section 4 B 171 In the brand name prescription drug industry, manufacturers often negotiate directly with indirect purchasers, who then purchase the drug from wholesalers Wholesalers then get \"charge backs\" from manufacturers for sales made at manufacturer negotiated prices See BNPD, 123 F 3d at 607 172 See Lucas Automotive Eng'g, Inc v Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc , 140 F 3d 1228, 1233 (9th Cir 1998) (citing Illinois Brick Co v Illinois, 431 U S 720, 728-29 (1977)) [Vol 68 1 Reexamining the Role of Illinois Brick been reversed On the one hand, Judge O'Scannlain may well have decided that the drug retailers, were they determined to be indirect purchasers, did not have standing On the other hand, Judge Posner may have ruled that an indirect purchaser who challenges a licensing agreement and can demonstrate damages other than an overcharge may seek relief In terms of consistency with Illinois Brick, Judge O'Scannlain's position seems to be the better reasoned of the two Illinois Brick's central teaching is that attempting to apportion overcharges must be avoided 173 Any action by an indirect purchaser is likely to begin with the question of what the price would have been to the buyer in the absence of the violation and how much of that overcharge was passed on to the plaintiff's customers Although Judge Scannlain's opinion may be more consistent with Illinois Brick's underlying rationales, Judge Posner's opinion may be superior from a policy standpoint In BNPD, the direct purchasers had not pursued whatever possible claims they might have had against the manufacturers, perhaps because their dependence on the manufacturers discouraged them from bringing a private action Indeed, one of the dangers recognized by the Illinois Brick Court-a fear or lack of incentive on the part of direct purchasers to bring an action-may have occurred 174 Thus, Judge Posner left open a possible avenue for private action by indirect purchasers 3 Campos v Ticketmaster Corp A third case that adds another dimension to both the dangers and the potential of Illinois Brick is Campos v Ticketmaster Corp 175 In Campos, a proposed class of ticket purchasers sued Ticketmaster, a ticket distribution service 176 Ticketmaster had long-term exclusive contracts with most concert promoters 7 7 As a consequence, a venue wishing to host an event typically had to use Ticketmaster to distribute its tickets This monopoly power, according to the plaintiffs, permitted Ticketmaster to charge them excessive amounts in the form of service charges 78 The Eighth Circuit held that Illinois Brick barred the action by the ticket purchasers The court seemed to broaden Illinois Brick significantly by citing it as standing for the proposition that \"[a]n indirect purchaser is one who bears some portion of a monopoly overcharge only by virtue of an antecedent transaction between the monopolist and another, independent purchaser \"'179 In Campos, the \"antecedent transaction\" was the initial contract between Ticketmaster and the venue Because this transaction determined from whom the plaintiffs would purchase tickets, the plaintiffs were rendered indirect purchasers 80 173 See Illinois Brick, 431 U S at 737 174 See id at 746 175 140 F 3d 1166 (8th Cir 1998) 176 See id at 1168 177 See id 178 See id at 1169 179 Id (emphasis added) 180 See id at 1171 In other words, the monopolist (Ticketmaster) sold its services to the direct purchaser (the venue) which then hosted the event for the indirect purchasers (the concert 1999] The George Washington Law Review To reach this conclusion, the Eighth Circuit reasoned that the ticket price and the service charge were both parts of an overall price of admission ' 81 Presumably, this price was set at a profit-maximizing level and, if Ticketmaster or some other distributor were not involved, this price was the price the venue itself would have charged 82 In effect, the service charge was a charge incurred-in the form of an allowance-by the venue itself for the services of Ticketmaster 83 The reasoning of the Eighth Circuit has some appeal from the standpoint of economic theory, but it is not clear that the opinion is consistent with Illinois Brick Essentially, the court reasoned that there is a single profitmaximizing price for the tickets, and the fact that the venue allowed another party to capture a portion of that price meant that the party paying that specific portion was an indirect purchaser 184 One problem with this theory is that the price charged in the form of service fees by Ticketmaster may not be the same as that charged by the venue if it sold the tickets directly Specifically, the court does not seem to understand the problem of successive monopoly The venue owner has some amount of market power that it can exploit by raising ticket prices above competitive levels Due to Ticketmaster's exclusive contracts with promoters, the venue must distribute its tickets through Ticketmaster, creating a second layer of market power that Ticketmaster can exploit by raising its fees for ticket distribution services The Campos plaintiffs complained about the noncompetitive price charged by Ticketmaster for distribution services As a result, these customers are direct purchasers of the distribution service and would not fail an Illinois Brick test Another problem with this decision is that it is not clear how broadly the court's analysis extends For example, according to the court, organizations such as Ticketmaster \"'compete to secure contracts with venues and event promoters for the right to sell tickets \"1 85 If one focuses on the notion of a \"right,\" the logical extension of the court's reasoning would seem to be that anyone who makes purchases from a party who has bought marketing or production rights from a third party is an indirect purchaser In all instances, the seller of the right could have combined the necessary inputs and sold them for the profit-maximizing price For example, suppose that a producer licenses production technology from a licensor of intellectual property In principle, according to Campos, the producer's customers would be indirect purchasers because the licensor could have produced the good and sold it directly to those customers This cannot make sense as a means of identifying indirect purchasers goers) As an economic matter, this makes no sense because the class alleged overcharges on Ticketmaster's services-not on the tickets How licketmaster acquired the power to impose overcharges on services ought to be irrelevant 181 See id 182 See id at 1172 183 See id 184 See id 185 Id at 1171 (quoting Note, Beyond Economic Theory A Model for Analyzing the Antitrust Implications of Exclusive Dealing Arrangements, 45 DuKE LJ 1009, 1015 (1996)) [Vol 68 1 Reexamining the Role of Illinois Brick Put more in terms of Illinois Brick, the issue becomes one of identifying the apportionment problem that is the central concern of that case In Campos, plaintiffs allege that, but for Ticketmaster's monopoly power, they would have paid lower service charges 186 In other words, if distribution rights had been shared among several firms, the plaintiffs would have paid less The issue is hardly one of apportionment, but is simply one of determining what the price would have been in the absence of Ticketmaster's alleged violation The proper analysis for a standing determination, therefore, would be under AGC, not Illinois Brick 87 4 In re Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litigation Campos seems to contrast sharply with the Third Circuit's decision in In re Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litigation,88 which involved an action by steel producers against railroads that allegedly had limited the development of less expensive means of transporting ore 8 9 In effect, because of the railroads' control of off-loading equipment, the steel companies were limited to the use of shippers that could use that equipment The producers claimed that, if the alternative means of transportation had been permitted to develop, they would have paid less for transportation 190 Clearly, actual and potential providers of alternative means of transportation felt the direct impact of the railroads' actions The plaintiffs calculated the damages as the difference between what they were paying for transportation to existing shippers and what they would have paid had new technologies been permitted to develop ' 9' The Third Circuit relied on AGC in finding that Illinois Brick was not a bar to recovery '92 The court conceded that the steel companies were \"in a sense, indirect purchasers,\"' 9 3 and addressed whether its reasoning was inconsistent with Illinois Brick According to the court, the fact that plaintiffs paid \"overcharges\" to third parties did not mean they were excluded under Illinois Brick Under its AGC analysis, the court focused on the fact that the actions by the railroads had a direct impact on the steel customers 194 In fact, the steel transport industry existed exclusively for the use of steel producers 195 The court also noted that the type of injury the plaintiffs sought to avoid was the type the antitrust laws were designed to prevent 196 Finally, the court addressed the problem of duplicative recovery by indicating that, 186 See id at 1169 187 The lower court had applied a standing analysis and held that plaintiffs did not have standing even if they were direct purchasers Arguably, this decision is incorrect Clearly, plaintiffs suffered

America, Inc 198 (\"SRS\"), one of the plaintiffs participated in sports car races organized and sanctioned by the defendant 99 The defendant also sold the only cars and parts that were permitted to be used in the sanctioned races 200 The defendant did not sell its cars and parts directly to participants, but through distributors 201 The plaintiff charged that the defendant was engaged in illegal monopolization of the specified cars and parts markets and tying 202 The Tenth Circuit began its analysis with the statement that \"[t]he Supreme Court has consistently held that only direct purchasers suffer injury within the meaning of § 4 of the Clayton Act ' 203 The court then held that the plaintiff lacked standing to bring a monopolization claim204 because it was an indirect purchaser of the racing cars and parts 205 Under the tying claim, the court identified the tying \"product\" as \"racing services\" and identified the tied product as the cars and parts that were required to compete in the races 2°6 Even though the plaintiff was an indirect purchaser in the tied product market the court ruled that the plaintiff did have standing 207 In thinking about the court's conclusion, it is important to remember that the monopolized market under the theory of monopolization was the same as the tied product market in the tying claim In other words, the alleged underlying anticompetitive aim was the same-the exertion of market power in the cars and parts market Yet, standing hinged on neither the underlying competitive harm nor the type of damages requested, but on the classification of the violation In some respects, the Tenth Circuit's opinion is similar to Judge Posner's in BNPD because characterization was the key even though the substance of the defendant's actions was no different Nevertheless, the opinion can be distinguished from Judge Posner's because changing the way the offense was 197 See id at 1169 The Third Circuit made an effort to

Brick framed did not necessarily change the way the damages were calculated 208 Instead, the pivotal factor in SRS was the \"label\" placed on the violation Perhaps most interesting was the Tenth Circuit's own change in analytical approach In the context of monopolization, the court adopted the per se standing rule by reasoning that indirect purchasers do not have standing 20 9 When reviewing the tying claim, however, it adopted a more pragmatic view The court reasoned that Illinois Brick could be interpreted as selecting the \"best\" plaintiff between the direct and indirect purchaser 210 In the case of an indirect purchaser of a tied item, the court held that the direct purchaser was merely a conduit and the \"best\" plaintiff was the indirect purchaser 211 This approach, although invoking the authority of Illinois Brick, is in substance closer to a direct application of AGC because the analysis is devoted to the relative merits of various potential plaintiffs E Summary The above analysis suggests that Illinois Brick is the odd culmination of an extended effort to reduce the barriers to antitrust recoveries Although Illinois Brick may have dealt effectively with problems that existed when it was decided, subsequent events have exposed numerous inconsistencies The most obvious inconsistency is that one of the pillars of Illinois Brick-avoidance of multiple liability-was undermined by ARC America, which cleared the way for indirect purchaser suits in state courts Even this, however, understates the problem Illinois Brick has not been undermined in a consistent or uniform sense Instead, the level of private antitrust enforcement depends on the geographic location of the suit One might argue that this is hardly the problem of Illinois Brick itself But the problem of differing levels of liability that depend on geographic location can be traced to the premise of that opinion The primary issue faced by the Illinois Brick Court was how it should deal with the offensive use of pass-on theories given that it had decided against defensive uses of those theories in Hanover Shoe 212 The Court could have overruled Hanover Shoe and permitted both offensive and defensive use of the pass-on theory, or it could have narrowed Hanover Shoe to capital goods 213 In either case, defensive use of the pass-on theory would have decreased the likelihood of multiple liability Thus, although it most likely did not conceive of the issue in these terms, the Illinois Brick Court opted for simplicity in the federal courts at the expense of potentially exposing defendants to multiple liability through state court actions The uncertainty that Illinois Brick now creates for defendants is duplicated for plaintiffs in two complementary ways The first deals with the level 208 Judge Posner suggested that the indirect purchasers could have used a different theory of liability as long as they did not ultimately base damages on an overcharge theory See In re Brand Name Prescription Litigation, 123 F 3d 599, 606 (7th Cir 1997) In SRS, however, the damage calculation was not part of the court's analysis See SRS, 131 F 3d at 890 209 See SRS, 131 F 3d at 884 210 See i at 889 211 See id 212 See Illinois Brick Co v Illinois, 431 U S 720, 728 (1977) 213 See id at 736 1999] The George Washington Law Review of enforcement and the second with the likelihood of compensation First, under current law, plaintiffs may fall under the general standing guidelines of AGC or the specific standards of Illinois Brick Illinois Brick is framed in terms of indirect purchasers214 while AGC uses the notion of remoteness 215 But the general concerns of both cases are the same with respect to finding the plaintiff or plaintiffs who will aggressively enforce the antitrust laws for the right reasons 216 In a number of cases involving price fixing, the plaintiffs most likely to pursue an antitrust claim may be indirect purchasers who conceivably could have standing under AGC, but are denied the opportunity to recover as indirect purchasers under Illinois Brick What this means is that the level of private enforcement may vary depending on the type of antitrust offense alleged Ironically, a lower level of enforcement is likely to take place when the practice-price fixing-is the most pernicious Second, from the perspective of compensating plaintiffs, Illinois Brick creates a situation in which plaintiffs' recovery is not based on whether a firm has violated antitrust laws or injured the plaintiffs, but on the nature of the violation But even this understates the artificiality of what separates those who have standing and those who lack it As BNPD and SRS illustrate, standing may hinge merely on how the activity is characterized 2 17 In practice, this will result in strained efforts to pigeonhole business conduct to evade the dictates of Illinois Brick A rational system of private enforcement would be one that does not vary by the type of violation, jurisdiction, or the nature of the plaintiff This is not to suggest that it is possible to determine a single level of enforcement But three goals stand out First, firms engaged in obviously anticompetitive activity should face generally the same level of exposure This is not the case now Take, for example, the case of price fixing by firms dealing with relatively weak buyers The risk of suit by the direct purchasers is low, and the risk of suit by an indirect purchaser is nonexistent unless a state permits it Second, firms acting within the gray areas of antitrust law should be able to draw some general conclusions of likely exposure Finally, plaintiffs should not be differentiated based on the type of violation lending to their injury or the skill of their attorneys in pleading around the indirect purchaser problem III Rationalizing Illinois Brick Identifying the inconsistencies and uncertainty created by Illinois Brick and subsequent decisions and statutes is a much easier undertaking than formulating practical solutions Nevertheless, this Article identifies three possi214 See id at 729 215 See Associated Gen Contractors, Inc v California State Council, Inc , 459 U S 519,540 (1983) (considering the \"chain of causation between the Union's injury and the alleged restraint in the market for construction subcontracts\") 216 See id at 542 Illinois Brick, 431 U S at 746 217 In BNPD, Judge Posner suggested that the plaintiffs could recharacterize their pricefixing claim as a group boycott to circumvent Illinois Brick, see In re Brand Name Prescription Litigation, 123 F 3d 599, 606 (7th Cir 1997), while the court in SRS denied the monopolization claim under Illinois Brick, but allowed the tying claim, see Sports Racing Servs , Inc v Sport Car Club of America, Inc , 131 F 3d 874, 890 (10th Cir 1997) [Vol 68 1 Reexamining the Role of Illinois Brick ble solutions The first would be to overturn both Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick and leave all issues of whether to recognize specific plaintiffs and particular types of damages to general standing requirements and the antitrust injury doctrine This approach would retain the overcharge measure of damages A second possibility would be to allow all parties to recover their actual damages Typically, this would be in the form of lost profits, but in the case of final users, including consumers, damages would continue to be the overcharge' or a portion of it 218 The requirement that actual damages be shown would seem to be responsive to the fear of multiple liability as expressed by the Illinois Brick Court It might also appear that this measure of damages would avoid the difficult process of tracing a fixed overcharge through a stream of purchasers This is not the case, however, because most efforts to determine the lost profits of an indirect purchaser will necessitate a determination of the extent to which the increased prices affected the indirect purchaser This simply means the Jost profit measure is no worse than the overcharge measure on this score At the same time, it is nevertheless a more precise measure of damages The third possibility would be to narrow Illinois Brick so that it applies only in suits for overcharge damages by indirect purchasers This approach would prevent extended applications of Illinois Brick, such as that found in Campos, but would leave open the possibility that some indirect purchasers might recast their theories of liability to overcome Illinois Brick Although this creates something of an inconsistency, the availability of more than one theory to plaintiffs may simply be an unavoidable consequence of the fact that antitrust violations can be characterized differently and courts will determine whether a plaintiff has been harmed depending on how the violation is characterized A Overturning Illinois Brick and Hanover Shoe The elimination of Illinois Brick and Hanover Shoe would leave the treatment of indirect purchasers to be determined under AGC and other standing decisions The chief advantage of such an approach is that it would blunt the impact of ARC America For example, defendants would be permitted to use a pass-on theory to reduce damages to the extent that an overcharge was passed on to indirect purchasers Those defendants would remain liable in federal courts to indirect purchasers who could satisfy the requirements of AGC In addition, whether successfully employing a pass-on defense or not, some defendants would remain liable to indirect purchasers in states with Illinois Brick legislation2 19 Most importantly, defendants would be far less vulnerable to different antitrust exposure depending on the geographic location of the offense 218 Clearly, in cases of purchases by municipalities, the proper damages measure would still be the overcharge 219 Some indirect purchasers would have a choice of federal or state court just as antitrust plaintiffs do, for the most part, today They would not, however, be able to recover in both state and federal court for the same damages 1999] The George Washington Law Review Overturning Illinois Brick and Hanover Shoe would not, however, automatically erase all inconsistencies An indirect purchaser applying federal law would be required to satisfy the standing requirements of AGC, but a plaintiff relying on state legislation permitting indirect purchaser action would likely have a lower burden The significance of this possible discrepancy would depend largely on the likelihood that courts would interpret AGC as permitting actions by indirect purchasers This is not a simple analysis because AGC not only assumes that suits by indirect purchasers are prohibited, it actually relies on Illinois Brick Still, it does appear that many indirect purchasers in price-fixing cases would pass the tests of AGC When examining indirect purchasers under the AGC analysis, two related factors stand out First, as noted earlier, AGC adopts antitrust injury as part of an overall standing analysis 220 Indirect purchasers almost certainly would pass this portion of an AGC analysis Second, AGC is, as a factual matter, a complex case The plaintiff was a labor union claiming it was damaged by contractors who were coercing employers to hire only non-union labor 221 Because of this factual wrinkle, the Court's reasoning supporting the necessity of limiting the scope of eligible plaintiffs has a great deal of appeal Specifically, the Court noted the difficulty of determining whether or not the union was injured and whether or not the market was rendered less competitive by the contractors' attempts to discourage the use of union labor =2 Moreover, the plaintiff made no allegation \"that output ha[d] been curtailed or prices enhanced \" 223 In the context of indirect purchasers, no such complexity exists Indirect purchasers are made worse off by paying higher prices than they otherwise would pay Whether they are final users or resellers, the injury is one readily recognized by the antitrust laws Indeed, the majority of cases in which the AGC test would be applied to indirect purchasers involves an offense-prices fixing-that is unlawful per se Thus, the proper perspective is one that replaces the complicated facts of AGC with the simple facts of a standard indirect purchaser case In this context, we can focus on the three most important factors recognized by the AGC Court First, the Court notes its concerns about the complexity of attempting to apportion damages 22 4 Second, the Court describes an interest in avoiding duplicative recoveries 225 Finally, the Court reasoned that \"[t]he existence of an identifiable class of persons whose self-interest would normally motivate them to vindicate the public interest in antitrust enforcement diminishes the justification for allowing a more remote party to perform the office of a private attorney general ' 226 This last hurdle is the most challenging for indirect purchasers 220 See AGC, 459 U S at 544 221 See id at 520-21 222 See id at 539 According to the Court, \"the Union was neither a consumer nor a competitor in the market in which trade was restrained \" Id 223 Id at 539 n 40 224 See id at 544-45 225 See id at 543-44 226 Id at 542 [Vol 68 1 1999] Reexamining the Role of Illinois Brick 29 1 The Complexity of Apportioning Damages The significance of the difficulties associated with damage apportionment can be greatly overdrawn In fact, one wonders just how much actual conviction lies behind the Court's position First, the difficult part of the apportioning process is determining the \"but for\" price for the indirect purchasers In other words, what price would these purchasers have paid \"but for\" the price fixing? Although difficult at times, the process is far from impossible and, in many circumstances, plaintiffs are likely to be able to satisfy the relatively relaxed standards for proving antitrust damages 227 To understand why, it is important to distinguish between proving damages and \"apportioning \" If a group of manufacturers were to fix prices on goods sold to fabricators who sell to distributors who sell to retailers who sell to consumers, estimating the amount passed on at each stage would be a daunting task An indirect purchaser, however, need not do this An indirect purchaser must estimate only the \"but for\" price that it should have paid, which is a far less exacting exercise than apportioning the overcharge throughout the entire chain of distribution To be sure, estimating the requisite \"but for\" price at the consumer stage, in this example, would not be easy because a great number of factors may affect that price 228 Still, any general fear of the difficulties indirect purchasers may experience in calculating the \"but for\" price to determine the overcharge can be overstated A determination of a \"but for\" price already is required in a great number of instances For example, Judge Posner's opinion in BNPD closes the door on indirect purchasers attempting to show overcharge damages and opens the door to proof of lost profits 229 The problem is that indirect purchasers almost certainly begin the process of calculating lost profits with a determination of the price they would have been charged \"but for\" the price fixing Not only is the determination of damages as much of a dilemma as the AGC Court would suppose, but the Court itself has shown less concern with the problem of complexity than its opinions in Illinois Brick and AGC suggest First, as a general matter, lost profits is the measure of damages in most antitrust cases 230 The use of lost profits necessitates a determination of the \"but for\" price whether the violation is tying, a group boycott, a refusal to deal, or monopolization In fact, the determination of a \"but for\" price by indirect purchasers in price-fixing cases may be even simpler than in many other instances because the violation itself directly affects price in an obvious way In the case of other violations, the impact on price is less obvious 227 See supra text accompanying notes 22-66 228 For an argument in favor of estimating overcharges for indirect purchasers, see Harris Sullivan, supra note 10 Elmer J Schaefer, Passing-on Theory in Antitrust Treble Damage Actions An Economic and Legal Analysis, 16 WM MARY L Rnv 883, 885-86 (1975) 229 See supra text accompanying notes 163-168 230 For example, in all cases involving exclusion (or foreclosure), the damage is lost profit on lost sales This follows because the lost profits due to exclusion involve the following computation price but for the exclusion times the quantity that would have been sold less the incremental costs of making those sales The George Washington Law Review Second, and more specifically, the Supreme Court's concern about complexity is, to some extent, belied by its actions in other instances For example, in Truett Payne Co v Chrysler Motors Corp ,231 the Court considered the application of so-called \"automatic damages\" in a Robinson-Patman Act claim 23 2 Automatic damages would be the difference between what the disfavored firm paid for the goods and the price it would have paid in the absence of discrimination multiplied by the number of units purchased 23 3 The Court rejected the use of an automatic overcharge in favor of lost profits 234 This lost profits measure, however, requires the disfavored firm to determine the price it would have paid \"but for\" the discrimination 235 The firm then must determine how much of this \"overcharge\" would have been passed on to customers and how much the \"overcharge\" ultimately would impact profit 23 6 It is difficult to square this assignment to plaintiffs in RobinsonPatman Act cases with the Court's efforts to avoid complexity and apportionment in AGC and Illinois Brick 237 More important, perhaps, is that the ultimate decision of whether a specific damage calculation has become too speculative would continue to lie within the purview of the trial court 23 8 Even under the relatively lax antitrust standards, a court can refuse to allow the matter to proceed to the trier of fact if the damage calculations are deemed speculative 3 9 2 Avoiding Multiple Liability The second of the three problems facing an indirect purchaser trying to satisfy the standards of AGC is probably the easiest with which to dispense The Court initially announced its concern about multiple liability in Illinois Brick 40 In that context, a concern about multiple liability made a great deal of sense because the Court already had ruled out the defensive use of pass-on theories in Hanover Shoe 241 In short, the threat of multiple liability was a real one given that the defendants could not off-set the amount by which direct purchasers passed overcharges on to their buyers By overruling both Illinois Brick and Hanover Shoe, the threat of multiple liability largely would be eliminated 231 451 U S 557 (1981) 232 15 U S C § 13(a) (1994) see J Truet Payne, 451 U S at 559-60 The case involved secondary line price discrimination Secondary line price discrimination involves injury to competition between and among different customers of the discriminating firm 233 See J Truett Payne, 451 U S at 560 234 See id at 561-62 235 See id at 562 236 See id at 564-65 237 The one consistent feature of these decisions-and several others of their era-is decreasing the level of private antitrust enforcement 238 Damage calculations are speculative due to a failure of proof See Blair Page, supra note 33, at 426 239 See Zenith Radio Corp v Hazeltine Research, Inc , 395 U S 100, 124 (1969) Bigelow v RKO Radio Pictures, Inc , 327 U S 251, 264 (1946) 240 See Illinois Brick Co v Illinois, 431 U S 720, 730 (1977) 241 See id at 729 [Vol 68 1 Reexamining the Role of Illinois Brick To some extent, however, the risk of multiple liability begs the issue The concept of \"multiple liability\" suggests some benchmark level of liability Yet, as indicated in the discussion above, lost profits and overcharges are different measures of damages 242 In addition, the overcharge is not equal to the plaintiffs losses nor the defendant's gain 24 3 Moreover, it is, at best, unusual to argue against multiple liability when the statutory scheme requires treble damages Finally, the threats of both allocative complexity and multiply liability are overstated when one actually understands the full strategic implications of overturning Illinois Brick and Hanover Shoe Without those cases, a defendant would be permitted to demonstrate the amount that plaintiff had passed on to indirect purchasers By doing so, the defendant makes the suit by indirect purchasers simpler because the evidence provided by the defendant in the direct purchaser's action could be used by the plaintiff in the indirect purchaser action In such a scenario, there would appear to be a risk that a defendant who fails to establish the existence of the pass-on in the direct purchaser actions would be vulnerable to duplicative recovery by an indirect purchaser 24 In this instance, however, the defendant will avoid duplicative recovery because she will have the evidence offered by the plaintiff proving that it did not pass the overcharge through to indirect purchasers Finally, it is possible as a procedural matter to join the various plaintiffs in order to remove all possibility of multiple liability This, of course, would be somewhat chaotic if there were a great number of indirect purchasers 24 5 3 Allowing Potential Plaintiffs with More Direct Interests to Pursue the Antitrust Claim This leaves the question of how indirect purchasers would be affected by the Court's admonition that the presence of potential plaintiffs who might be more directly affected \"diminishes\" the justification for permitting more remotely affected parties to bring an action 246 The AGC Court's direction here is not stated in absolute terms Thus, the questions for indirect purchasers may be how much the justification is diminished It is difficult to consider such a question in a vacuum For practical purposes, however, the issue can be addressed by asking whether indirect purchasers like those in Illinois 242 See infra text accompanying notes 269-274 243 See supra note 48 244 There is also a possibility of incomplete recovery For example, suppose cement manufacturers collude on the price charged to ready-mix concrete companies The ready-mix dealers sue and recover a portion of the overcharge The masonry contractor absorbs part of the overcharge and also sues The homeowner who buys the concrete sidewalk may be deemed too remote and denied standing In that case, the full overcharge will not be recovered This, of course, will weaken the deterrent effect of the private enforcement provision 245 The device of interpleader would seem to be useful as a means of avoiding this problem This possibility is discussed by the Illinois Brick Court and rejected primarily due to practical problems See Illinois Brick, 431 U S at 738 n 19 246 See Associated Gen Contractors, Inc v California State Council, Inc , 459 U S 519,542 (1983) 1999] The George Washington Law Review Brick are more like the union in AGC or more like the plaintiff in Blue Shield v McCready,247 the Court's other major antitrust standing decision In McCready, the plaintiff's employer supplied medical insurance as part of her compensation 248 By virtue of an agreement between Blue Cross and the psychiatrists, the plan purchased by her employer did not provide coverage for psychotherapy offered by psychologists unless they were working with a psychiatrist 249 The employee, McCready, claimed that the exclusion of psychologists violated the Sherman Act 250 The Court held that McCready had antitrust standing to pursue her claims 251 It is important to note that the direct purchaser in McCready was her employer, or perhaps even Blue Cross 252 McCready, in effect, indirectly \"purchased\" the insurance coverage by exchanging her labor for her employer's compensation package This suggests that McCready stands for the proposition that at least some indirect purchasers have antitrust standing In comparing the position of the plaintiff in McCready with that of the union in AGC two factors stand out First, as the Court correctly notes in AGC, it is not clear whether and how the union's interests would be served by greater competition in the market for labor 5 3 This factor, more than any other, would seem to diminish the justification for permitting the union to pursue its antitrust action By comparison, McCready would benefit from competition in the form of lower prices and higher quality services In addition, the \"diminished justification\" analysis of AGC can be read as requiring a comparison of the remotely affected party with more directly affected parties 25 4 In other words, the issue may be viewed in terms of each party's relative aggressiveness in acting as a private attorney general In this context, one might ask how did McCready compare with other potential plaintiffs in her case relative to how the union in AGC compared with other potential plaintiffs in that case? In McCready, two other groups of possible plaintiffs had an interest in pressing an antitrust claim 25 5 The first was psychologists who were, in effect, the subject of a boycott by Blue Cross and the psychiatrists These psychologists would seem to be the most directly affected group The second was McCready's employer, who purchased the insurance tainted by anticompetitive action The employer would have an interest in getting the lowest price for the greatest array of services for its payment In AGC, on the other hand, the obvious alternative plaintiffs 247 457 U S 465 (1982) 248 See id at 467-68 249 See id at 468 250 See id at 469-70 251 See id at 485 252 To the extent that Blue Cross previously agreed on the reimbursements to be paid providers for various services, Blue Cross actually is buying the services for its subscribers 253 See Associated Gen Contractors, Inc v California State Council, Inc , 459 U S 519,539 (1983) 254 See id at 542 255 A third possible group was Blue Cross, which may have found that the psychiatrists demanded exclusivity to be included on the list of providers [Vol 68 1 Reexamining the Role of Illinois Brick would be contractors who would like to hire non-union labor without fear of economic consequence 25 6 This analysis suggests that McCready and the union were both indirectly affected The cases are different, however, with respect to the nature of this indirect link McCready received a \"product,\" essentially passed on intact, that had been affected by anticompetitive behavior, and the direct purchaser may or may not have been more motivated to bring an antitrust action 25 7 The direct purchaser's motivation could well depend, as the Court has noted, on the ability of the direct purchaser to pass the overcharge along and its unwillingness to bring an action against suppliers it may have to depend on in the future 25 8 On the other hand, the directly affected parties in AGC were hardly simple conduits of a product 25 9 Rather, it was these parties to whom coercion was directly applied in order to affect their actions in the market This distinction between AGC and McCready suggests two points First, the remoteness issue in AGC is relatively obvious and, consequently, AGC is not very helpful when it comes to the more borderline cases involving indirect purchasers Second, the cases together indicate that the difference between direct and indirect purchasers is a matter of degree while the difference between an indirect purchaser and other indirectly affected parties is a difference in kind Comparing the relative levels motivating direct and indirect purchasers to act as private attorneys general is an empirical question that courts seem unlikely to be able to answer Thus, under AGC and in a judicial world without Illinois Brick and Hanover Shoe, both direct and indirect purchasers should be presumed to have standing 260 On the other hand, standing decisions resting on differences in the kind of impact are the sort courts are better able and expected to make 261 4 Benefits of Barring Some Indirect Purchaser Claims This is not to suggest that all the arguments against barring indirect purchaser actions are unimportant No doubt, overturning Illinois Brick and Hanover Shoe would result in more antitrust claims by indirectly affected parties 262 For example, suppose a manufacturer of building materials purchases sand and sells some of it to toy manufacturers, who then package it and sell it for use in sand boxes that are purchased by childcare centers Would the individual who makes use of and pays for the services of the childcare center be permitted to bring an action if the producers of sand allegedly were engaged in price fixing? Without Illinois Brick, there would not be a 256 See AGC, 459 U S at 541 257 See Blue Shield v McCready, 457 U S 465, 480 (1982) 258 Of course, what is passed on in McCready is a lower quality product, but this should not alter the analysis 259 See AGC, 459 U S at 539 260 Remotely affected indirect purchasers, as explained below, may fail the AGC test 261 There would continue to be, however, difficult standing decisions in a great variety of other cases 262 One should not overstate the increase, however, because a number of states already permit indirect purchaser actions 1999] The George Washington Law Review \"bright line\" answer to this Nevertheless, under the analysis of AGC, it is a virtual certainty that the parents would not have antitrust standing The increase in antitrust claims, in general, may not be as great as one would initially expect Several states already permit actions by indirect purchasers 263 In addition, as matters now stand, a plaintiff or class of indirect plaintiffs may have to bring an action in several different states With indirect purchaser access to federal courts, there could be a single action If all the relevant parties could be joined in a single action, the costs of litigation actually might decrease In addition, by allowing indirect purchasers access to federal courts, antitrust would regain some of the enforcement lost when ARC America was decided B Lost Profits as a Uniform Measure of Damages 1 Lost Profits and the Overcharge Measure of Damages Overruling Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick would not only allow indirect purchasers to recover the portion of the illegal overcharge that is passed on, it also would make it more likely that all plaintiffs could recover actual damages Allowing injured parties to collect actual damages is consistent with the language of the Clayton Act, which makes a remedy available to \"any person who shall be injured in his business or property\" and sets that remedy at \"threefold the damages by him sustained 2 64 For consumers, the damages sustained would be the difference between the price actually paid and the price that would have been paid \"but for\" the conspiracy It does not matter whether these consumers were direct or indirect purchasers their damages would be captured by the overcharge that they experienced 2 65 Businesses, however, make purchases to produce goods and services that are subsequently resold As a result, these firms may pass on some or all of the overcharge Consequently, the damages sustained are captured appropriately by their lost profits 266 Part of the appeal of the lost profits measure of damages is supplied by the Clayton Act, which provides a right of recovery to \"any person who shall be injured in his business or property '267 Injury to a business results in reduced profits Part of the appeal also stems from the fact that the overcharge as a measure of damages is not precisely the same as the lost profit Moreover, the overcharge does not even deviate from actual damages in any predictable direction or by any consistent amount The explanation is actually rather simple Consider what happens to competitive firms that are overcharged by a price-fixing cartel Suppose that each unit of the firms' competitively produced output requires one unit of the cartel's input The collusive increase in the price of that input will cause the 263 For an excellent analysis of state indirect purchaser suits, see Page, supra note 113 264 15 U S C § 15(a) (1994) 265 In most circumstances, there are welfare losses-that is, damages-suffered by consumers who are priced out of the market These damages would be extraordinarily difficult to measure and typically are not cognizable See ROGER D BLAIR DAVID L KASERMAN, ANTrIRusT ECONOMIcS 78 (1985) 266 For an analysis of lost profits, see Harrison, supra note 38 267 15 U S C § 15(a) [Vol 68 1 Reexamining the Role of Illinois Brick firms' cost of production per unit to increase by the amount of the overcharge 268 The effect of the overcharge on the victims' profits will depend upon what happens to the output price, which is governed by supply and demand conditions At one extreme, suppose that demand is perfectly elastic, meaning that any effort to raise price will be futile The affected firms will find it optimal to reduce their output As a consequence, not only will these firms be paying more for the input, but as their output decreases, they likely will produce that output in an inefficient manner More technically, the cost increase is compounded by the unexploited economies of scale that result in the short run As a result, the lost profits will exceed the overcharge 269 In this instance, the overcharge undercompensates the victim At the other extreme, suppose that demand is perfectly inelastic In other words, buyers do not respond to price increases Consequently, the competitive price of the victims' output will rise by the full amount of the overcharge The firms will continue to produce the original output without losing any profit In effect, there is no injury, and the damages sustained are zero The overcharge clearly overstates the lost profits because there were no lost profits The victims continue to earn a competitive return on their investment 270 In this instance, the overcharge overcompensates the \"victim \" 268 More technically, both average cost and marginal cost will increase by the amount of the overcharge 269 These results are easy to demonstrate In Figure 1, the competitive firm initially had average and marginal cost curves of AC, and MCI, respectively At a competitive price of P1, the firm maximized its profit by producing where price was equal to marginal cost, i e , at a quantity of Q1 As Figure 1 reveals, the competitive firm sold Q, at the competitive price and earned a competitive return in doing so Although price equals average cost at Q, and the firm's profits are zero, the firm still earns a competitive return on its investment because that is part of the cost In other words, the average cost curve has embedded within it a competitive return The influence of the cartel overcharge is to shift the average and marginal cost curves from AC and MCI to AC2 and MC2, respectively If the price does not rise at all, the competitive firm in Figure 2 will respond to the higher cost of producing that quantity where MC2 equals P1, i e , it will produce Q2 Now, the firm's lost profit will be equal to the loss that it experiences, which equals (AC2 - PI)Q2 The overcharge, however, is equal to the increase in average cost times the quantity purchased, which equals (AC2 - AC,)Q2 One can see by inspecting Figure 1 that the lost profit exceeds the overcharge, which is what we claimed in the text Pad-,cmt Figure 1 AC, A, C AC AC, P 0 0 0 OQ Uty 270 These results are also relatively easy to show Figure 2 is precisely the same as Figuie 1 except that price has now risen to P2 Consequently, the competitive firm will continue to produce Q, because the new marginal cost (MC2) equals the new price (P2) at a quantity of Q, In this case, the overcharge equals the difference between AC and AC2 times the quantity, which 1999] The George Washington Law Review We have analyzed the polar cases If demand is perfectly elastic, price does not rise and lost profits clearly exceed the overcharge If demand is perfectly inelastic, price rises by the full amount of the overcharge, but profits are unaffected The overcharge measure of damages is inadequate in one case while it is excessive in the other Admittedly, demand is not apt to be perfectly elastic or perfectly inelastic, but the fact remains that the overcharge measure is an inexact proxy for the actual damages, which are the lost profits 271 This analysis suggests that much of the judicial hand wringing about multiple liability and the allocation problem is misplaced After all, the measure of damage adopted-the overcharge-was never equal to the damages suffered by most victims, nor, as illustrated earlier, was it even equal to the ill-gotten gains of the price fixers 272 2 Problems in Estimating Lost Profit A complete examination of the difficulties in estimating lost profits will take us too far afield, but a few observations are in order First, one must recognize that lost profits are equal to the difference between the profits actually earned and the profits that would have been earned \"but for\" the antitrust violation Because one must estimate what might have been, an inevitable imprecision accompanies this exercise The Supreme Court has expressed a tolerance for this imprecision \"[I]t will be enough if the evidence shows the extent of the damages as a matter of just and reasonable inference \" 273 The inevitable uncertainty associated with estimation and inference has been recognized for well over half a century \"[t]he rule which precludes the recovery of uncertain damages applies to such as are not the certain result of the wrong, not to those damages which are definitely attributable to the wrong and only uncertain in respect of their amount \"274 In other words, the plaintiffs burden is to \"make a just and reasonable estimate of the damage based on relevant data \"275 equals (AC2 -AC) Qi But there is no lost profit because the new price fully covers the increased costs All of the overcharge was passed on to the customers of the overcharged producers Pri and Cost Figure 2 P 0I 271 If demand is highly elastic, we will observe results similar to those in Figure 1 If demand is highly inelastic, we will get results similar to those in Figure 2 It is highly improbable that the demand elasticity will be such that the overcharge will precisely equal the lost profit 272 See supra note 48 273 Story Parchment Co v Paterson Parchment Paper Co , 282 U S 555, 563 (1931) 274 Id at 562 275 Bigelow v RICO Radio Picture, Inc , 327 U S 251, 264 (1946) [Vol 68 1 Reexamining the Role of Illinois Brick Second, a reasonable inference differs from mere speculation Admissible damage estimates must be more than a stab in the dark Damage estimates will be deemed insufficient as a matter of law, and therefore inadmissible, if are a product of mere speculation and guesswork 27 6 Because juries cannot be asked to speculate, insufficient damage evidence cannot be put before the jury 277 One also should recognize that these difficulties of estimating lost profits are no worse than those associated with estimating an overcharge For the latter, one must establish the price actually paid, which is usually available from normal business records This actual price is compared to the price that would have been paid \"but for\" the price fixing The \"but for\" price is the price that unimpeded forces of supply and demand would have produced Consequently, one must control for a variety of economic and demographic factors that influence supply and demand This effort is not apt to be completely successful and, therefore, some degree of imprecision will infect the estimation of the \"but for\" price 3 Avoiding the Speculative Label To avoid having a damage estimate characterized as speculative, certain steps must be taken For one thing, a plaintiff claiming lost profits during the damage period should have a history of profitable operations in the past In estimating what the profits would have been \"but for\" the antitrust violation, the plaintiff must consider other factors that would have influenced the profits during the damage period Some factors-growth, enhanced efficiencies, reduction in competition-may have caused profits to rise, while other factors-increased costs, increased competition, regulatory changes-may have caused profits to fall Accounting for every potential influence may not be possible, but the most important components should be examined 278 4 Lost Profits and Deterrence The most glaring weakness of relying on lost profits as the appropriate measure of damages is the reduced deterrent effect that may result Take, for example, the recent litigation concerning the lysine cartel Lysine is essential to animal nutrition and is used as an additive in animal feed 279 Archer Daniels Midland and other producers fixed the price of lysine, thereby overcharging feed suppliers 280 The overcharged direct buyer clearly would have standing to sue for the lost profits that resulted The price of the feed to the farmer would reflect the higher cost of the lysine, thereby reducing the farmer's profits In principle, these losses should be recoverable, but in prac276 See Home Placement Servs , Inc v Providence Journal Co , 819 F 2d 1199, 1205 (1st Cir 1987) (finding that lost profit damages are inappropriate where the plaintiff has introduced no evidence tending to establish comparability between its own business and other companies engaged in similar business pursuits) 277 See id at 1208-09 (explaining that triers of fact must have sufficient evidence to make reasonable inferences, and may not speculate on appropriate damage awards) 278 For an extended examination of speculative damages, see Blair Page, supra note 33 279 See United States v Andreas, 39 F Supp 2d 1048, 1054 n 1 (N D Ill 1998) 280 See id 1999] The George Washington Law Review tice, such recovery may be problematic due to issues of standing Presumably, the price of the animals will be higher due to the higher feed price, which was due to the higher lysine price These higher prices will reduce the profits of the meat packer Again, these losses should be recoverable in principle, but are problematic in practice Similar fates await the distributor, the retailer, and finally the consumer 281 To the extent that standing rules preclude recovery by some of those who have suffered lost profits, compensation will be inadequate and the deterrent effect of section 4 of the Clayton Act will be reduced C Refining Illinois Brick The most modest of the three proposals is to retain Illinois Brick, but to refine it in a way that would permit consistent interpretations 282 The problem now is that Illinois Brick interpretations have shifted from time to time, making it difficult to identify a single underlying principle 28 3 The principle tension seems to be whether Illinois Brick is mainly about avoiding the complexity of damage claims based on an overcharge or is to be regarded as a per se application of AGC by barring claims by indirect purchasers 28 4 The cases discussed earlier-Lucas Automotive, BNPD, Campos, Lower Lake Erie, and SRS2 5-are indicative of the problems of applying Illinois Brick in a consistent fashion In Lucas Automotive, the Ninth Circuit seemed to perceive Illinois Brick as ultimately a standing decision 28 6 According to that court, \"an indirect purchaser  lacks standing \"28 7 In other words, indirect purchasers are too remote (a standing concept) to recover under the antitrust laws In BNPD, however, Judge Posner seemed to interpret Illinois Brick as driven primarily by concerns about damage apportionment, suggesting that the plaintiffs reframe their theory of liability to avoid relying on an over281 The problem is even more complicated when restaurants buy the meat and prepare it for consumers 282 Obviously, in light of ARC America, complete consistency is impossible 283 One area in which there is relative clarity concerns actions for injunctive relief Illinois Brick and its predecessor, Hanover Shoe, concerned actions for damages related to an overcharge This left open the question of whether Illinois Brick applies to indirect purchasers who ask for injunctive relief in overcharge cases The answer to this question has generally been no, see, e g , Campos v Tlicketmaster, 140 F 3d 1166 (8th Cir 1998) Labrador, Inc v IAMS Co , 105 F 3d 665 (9th Cir 1996) Mid-West Paper Prods Co v Continental Group, 596 F 2d 573 (3d Cir 1979), which makes a great deal of sense if one views Illinois Brick strictly from a pragmatic point of view A court's decision concerning injunctive relief does not raise the issues of multiple liability or damage apportionment In these instances, Illinois Brick clearly stands for a rule concerning the remedy sought If courts had adopted the view that indirect purchasers lack standing, even injunctive relief would be ruled out It seems possible, in theory, that an indirect purchaser asking for injunctive relief could satisfy Illinois Brick and still not satisfy the requirements of AGC For example, although there is no apportionment problem, one might apply the \"diminished justification\" rationale of AGC as a means of barring an indirect purchaser's action for an injunction 284 See supra text accompanying notes 154-207 285 See supra text accompanying notes 155-211 286 See supra text accompanying notes 155-162 287 Lucas Automotive Eng'g, Inc v Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc , 140 F 3d 1228, 1233 (9th Cir 1998) [Vol 68 1 1999] Reexamining the Role of Illinois Brick 39 charge measure of damages 28 8 In fact, both BNPD and SRS suggest that a plaintiff's right to relief hinges more on the plaintiff's proper labeling of the defendant's conduct than it does on the defendant's conduct, the competitive impact of that conduct, or the injury to the plaintiff 8 9 Campos shares some features with both Lucas Automotive and BNPD As in Lucas, the analysis of the Eighth Circuit in Campos centers around the positioning or remoteness of the plaintiff vis-a-vis the defendant 290 Accordingly, the plaintiff had been affected by an \"antecedent transaction \" 291 Evidently, this is something different than an actual sale and subsequent resale of an item-thus, an issue of remoteness, albeit somewhat vaguer than that in Lucas Automotive On the other hand, because the damages claimed were part of what the court viewed as a monopoly overcharge, elements of BNPD are present as well Finally, the Third Circuit in Lower Lake Erie premised its holding on the observation that \"[a]lthough [defendant] suggests that indirect purchaser status is the death knell of plaintiff's claim, this conclusion is not supported by the current law '' 292 It then proceeded to decide the Illinois Brick issue on the basis of what was essentially an AGC analysis 293 The point to be stressed here is not that these opinions are internally inconsistent,294 nor that the outcomes, considered individually, are necessarily poor ones Instead, the point is that a general rule of what Illinois Brick stands for, which can be applied in a sensible way from case to case, is lacking This is not to say that it is a simple matter to determine an ideal application of Illinois Brick In fact, there is probably no consensus on what single interpretation of Illinois Brick would yield an optimal level of antitrust enforcement Instead, as with so many issues in law, the challenge is to find an application that minimizes ambiguities and the potential for inconsistencies Thus, the best interpretation of Illinois Brick simply may be one that is the least susceptible to misinterpretation by lower courts 295 A firm, albeit imperfect, rule that is subject to limited interpretation is likely to be an important step in the evolution of a more rational system of enforcement Just as clear property rules facilitate mutually advantageous exchanges, clear legal rules make for focused and rational judicial decision-making The possibili-, ties range from a very broad application of Illinois Brick to a very narrow one For reasons set out below, the narrowest application may hold the greatest potential for consistency from plaintiff to plaintiff and court to court 288 See In re Brand Name Prescription Litigation, 123 F 3d 599, 606 (7th Cir 1997) 289 See id Sports Racing Servs , Inc v Sports Car Club of Am , Inc , 131 F 3d 874, 890 (10th Cir 1997) 290 See Campos v Ticketmaster Corp , 140 F 3d 1166, 1169-71 (8th Cir 1998) 291 Id at 1169 292 In re Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litig , 998 F 2d 1144, 1168 (3d Cir 1993) 293 See id at 1164-71 294 Although to some extent they are 295 One possibility that is related to the proposal discussed in the previous section is to interpret Illinois Brick as prohibiting indirect purchasers from asking for damages equal to a passed-on overcharge This proposal results in the desired consistency, however, only if both direct and indirect purchasers are limited to lost profits Otherwise, there is a possibility of multiple liability As noted earlier, the passed-on overcharge would still be in order for consumers The George Washington Law Review 1 A Broad Application of Illinois Brick A broad and relatively simple application of Illinois Brick would bar all suits by all indirect purchasers In other words, indirect purchasers would be eliminated regardless of how those purchasers framed their complaints This interpretation is consistent with the view that Illinois Brick identifies a subclass of victims who automatically fail the test of AGC Such a rule, broadly applied, would eliminate plaintiffs similar to the plaintiff in SRS, who had indirectly purchased a tied item 296 The rule also would eliminate plaintiffs such as those in Lower Lake Erie, who claimed the railroads inhibited the development of cheaper means of transporting ore 297 More importantly, the plaintiffs, such as those in BNPD, would not be able to bring their action in any form once they were identified as indirect purchasers 298 Finally, holdings like that in Campos and Lucas would likely stand 299 The complete elimination of indirect purchasers holds some promise for consistent results because it would eliminate the ability of some plaintiffs to recharacterize their actions to avoid Illinois Brick 300 In addition, one can argue that, when an indirect purchaser is involved, there is by definition another more directly affected plaintiff who could pursue the antitrust claim Although such an approach may provide something of a \"bright line,\" there are limitations For example, as Campos illustrates, it is not always a simple matter to determine when a purchaser is indirect or when the purchaser is remotely affected 301 This may lead to inconsistent results between similarly remote plaintiffs A comparison of the plaintiff in McCready with the purchasers in Illinois Brick makes this clear 302 Thus, a general rule barring indirect purchasers is not a rule that treats similarly remote victims alike, but one that discriminates among remote purchasers on the basis of the formalistic nature of a relationship that, in and of itself, has no substantive antitrust importance In addition, a broader application of Illinois Brick would increase one of the dangers that the Court recognized when it decided that case-direct purchasers may not be highly motivated to bring an antitrust action against an important supplier 303 SRS probably represents a good example of this, as does BNPD 304 This problem could be mitigated to some extent by a fuller development of the \"control\" exception of Illinois Brick 305 296 See supra text accompanying notes 198-211 297 See supra text accompanying notes 188-197 298 See supra text accompanying notes 163-174 299 See supra text accompanying notes 155-162, 175-187 300 See, e g , In re Brand Name Prescription Litigation, 123 F 3d 599 (7th Cir 1997) 301 See supra text accompanying notes 155-162 302 See discussion supra notes 247-263 303 See Illinois Brick Co v Illinois, 431 U S 720, 745 (1977) 304 In BNPD, the direct purchasers were wholesalers that acted primarily as conduits for the major drug producers See BNPD, 123 F 3d at 603 305 See discussion supra note 81 [Vol 68 1 Reexamining the Role of Illinois Brick 2 Middle Ground Application of Illinois Brick A middle position would be one based on a rigid interpretation of Illinois Brick that includes a set of clearly defined exceptions beyond the costplus and \"control\" exceptions 3 0 6 For example, one such exception would permit SRS-type plaintiffs-indirect purchasers from a firm engaged in tying-to bring an action 3 07 The rationale would be that the direct purchaser is only a conduit and that the supplier is actually applying coercion to the indirect purchaser, not the direct purchaser In addition, absent the threat of action by the indirect purchaser, the only potential plaintiffs would be the foreclosed sellers of the tied good In a sense, though, this exception provides insight into the difficulty of creating exceptions and addressing the questions that the exceptions raise For example, the universal rule would eliminate plaintiffs who claim to be indirectly affected by monopolization or attempts to monopolize 30 8 Two inconsistencies stand out First, monopolization and attempts to monopolize claims often rely on variations on the leverage theory underlying tying claims 30 9 Thus, a rigid application of the exception would mean that a firm requiring resellers to carry its brand exclusively would not be answerable to the customers who purchase from the coerced resellers Second, it is far from obvious that direct purchasers from firms engaged in monopolizing efforts are uniformly more inclined to bring antitrust actions against their suppliers than indirect victims of price fixing or tying In short, an exception for those indirectly affected by tying lacks substantive integrity because it distinguishes plaintiffs on the basis of form only 3 A Narrow Application of Illinois Brick A final approach, and the one that may be the least imperfect, is to narrow Illinois Brick strictly to its facts Thus, Illinois Brick would come into play only when (1) the plaintiffs are indirect purchasers, (2) a product actually passes through a direct purchaser to the indirect purchaser, and (3) the offense is price fixing All other plaintiffs would be required to clear the hurdles of AGC This relatively objective checklist would mean that the mischief resulting from Illinois Brick would largely be eliminated Courts, plain306 Even those plaintiffs qualifying for an exception would have to pass the AGC tests to have antitrust standing An issue left open would be whether a purchaser from the direct victim of a tying arrangement would fit within the exception For example, a buyer of shoes from a shoemaker who is a direct victim of at tying arrangement may pay more than he or she would in the absence of tying Whether or not Illinois Brick would bar this type of plaintiff is irrelevant because the suit almost certainly would be barred by AGC 307 A possible way to this outcome would be to apply the \"control\" exception of Illinois Brick to instances in which the direct purchaser is simply a conduit for the tied product 308 Interestingly, Hanover Shoe, the case leading to Illinois Brick, dealt with monopolization, many aspects of which involved the use of leverage 309 Monopolization and tying both rely on the \"use\" of market power Compare United States v Griffith, 334 U S 100, 106-07 (1948) (concluding that the use of monopoly power, even if lawfully acquired, in unfair competitive practices, is unlawful), with Jefferson Parish Hosp Dist v Hyde, 466 U S 2 (1984) (explaining that the existence of tied products requires an examination of how its use affects the markets and is not per se illegal) 1999] The George Washington Law Review tiffs, and defendants would devote far fewer resources to the question of whether Illinois Brick applies in particular instances Admittedly, this solution is subject to many of the same criticisms as the previous suggestions For example, it is arbitrary in that policies underlying Illinois Brick would support limiting suits by plaintiffs beyond the indirect purchasers identified here In addition, thisrnarrow application would do little to resolve the inconsistency between those indirect purchasers who can reframe their claims as a boycott and those who can not Although this inconsistency can be limited by the proper application of the more general standing requirements of AGC, such a limitation would not fully address the problem Still, as imperfect it as it is, a firm Illinois Brick rule would allow litigants to focus on a narrow scope of issues and would permit the evolution of a more rational system of antitrust enforcement Conclusion The Supreme Court's decision in Illinois Brick is obsolete It was necessary when it was decided because of the development of the overcharge measure of damages in private antitrust actions and the Court's decision in Hanover Shoe Unfortunately, whatever rationalizing effect Illinois Brick had was quickly and severely undercut by ARC America In addition, almost immediately after Illinois Brick, the Supreme Court began to develop more general guidelines that address the broader Illinois Brick problem-what private parties have standing to enforce the antitrust laws Had this later development come before Illinois Brick, it is questionable whether Illinois Brick would have been necessary Even if the Illinois Brick issue had been addressed under the antitrust standards developed in McCready and AGC, it is not clear that a per se rule blocking suits by indirect purchasers would have developed Instead, issues of remoteness, multiple liability, and damage calculation could have been assessed on a case-by-case basis Today, Illinois Brick and more general standards for antitrust standing operate simultaneously, resulting in a derationalization of the system of private enforcement The ability of a plaintiff to bring a claim can turn on the way the plaintiff frames her complaint It also can turn on whether the plaintiff is viewed as being indirectly affected (an Illinois Brick term) or remotely affected (an AGC term) Finally, a plaintiff's ability to sue can depend on how broadly or narrowly a court chooses to interpret what it means to be an \"indirect\" purchaser This Article has offered a number of solutions to this inconsistency First, both Illinois Brick and Hanover Shoe could be overturned and the issue of indirect purchaser standing assessed under general antitrust standing guidelines Second, if actual damages were adopted as the routine measure of recovery in antitrust cases, not only would recoveries be more in line with actual damages, but some of the issues Illinois Brick sought to address would become less important Finally, Illinois Brick could be retained, but clarified in such a way that inconsistencies from circuit to circuit would be reduced We cannot report that any one of these proposals will fully rationalize the system of private enforcement Part of the problem is that the Supreme [Vol 68 1 1999] Reexamining the Role of Illinois Brick 43 Court in ARC America has held that states may, in effect, maintain their own antitrust regimes These statutory schemes vary from state to state, and when combined with federal antitrust law, they make for what amounts to a broad spectrum of antitrust law that varies by jurisdiction Thus, no single action by the Supreme Court is capable of achieving consistency There is, however, utility in creating consistency at least with respect to what the federal law says about private enforcement of those laws Any of the proposals would seem to further that end"}

Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (the “Agencies”) with respect to mergers and acquisitions involving actual or potential competitors (“horizontal mergers”) under the federal antitrust laws 1 The relevant statutory provisions include Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U S C § 18, Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U S C §§ 1, 2, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U S C § 45 Most particularly, Section 7 of the Clayton Act prohibits mergers if “in any line of commerce or in any activity affecting commerce in any section of the country, the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly ” The Agencies seek to identify and challenge competitively harmful mergers while avoiding unnecessary interference with mergers that are either competitively beneficial or neutral Most merger analysis is necessarily predictive, requiring an assessment of what will likely happen if a merger proceeds as compared to what will likely happen if it does not Given this inherent need for prediction, these Guidelines reflect the congressional intent that merger enforcement should interdict competitive problems in their incipiency and that certainty about anticompetitive effect is seldom possible and not required for a merger to be illegal These Guidelines describe the principal analytical techniques and the main types of evidence on which the Agencies usually rely to predict whether a horizontal merger may substantially lessen competition They are not intended to describe how the Agencies analyze cases other than horizontal mergers These Guidelines are intended to assist the business community and antitrust practitioners by increasing the transparency of the analytical process underlying the Agencies’ enforcement decisions They may also assist the courts in developing an appropriate framework for interpreting and applying the antitrust laws in the horizontal merger context These Guidelines should be read with the awareness that merger analysis does not consist of uniform application of a single methodology Rather, it is a fact-specific process through which the Agencies, guided by their extensive experience, apply a range of analytical tools to the reasonably available and reliable evidence to evaluate competitive concerns in a limited period of time Where these Guidelines provide examples, they are illustrative and do not exhaust the applications of the relevant principle 2 1 These Guidelines replace the Horizontal Merger Guidelines issued in 1992, revised in 1997 They reflect the ongoing accumulation of experience at the Agencies The Commentary on the Horizontal Merger Guidelines issued by the Agencies in 2006 remains a valuable supplement to these Guidelines These Guidelines may be revised from time to time as necessary to reflect significant changes in enforcement policy, to clarify existing policy, or to reflect new learning These Guidelines do not cover vertical or other types of non-horizontal acquisitions 2 These Guidelines are not intended to describe how the Agencies will conduct the litigation of cases they decide to bring Although relevant in that context, these Guidelines neither dictate nor exhaust the range of evidence the Agencies may introduce in litigation 1    The unifying theme of these Guidelines is that mergers should not be permitted to create, enhance, or entrench market power or to facilitate its exercise For simplicity of exposition, these Guidelines generally refer to all of these effects as enhancing market power A merger enhances market power if it is likely to encourage one or more firms to raise price, reduce output, diminish innovation, or otherwise harm customers as a result of diminished competitive constraints or incentives In evaluating how a merger will likely change a firm’s behavior, the Agencies focus primarily on how the merger affects conduct that would be most profitable for the firm A merger can enhance market power simply by eliminating competition between the merging parties This effect can arise even if the merger causes no changes in the way other firms behave Adverse competitive effects arising in this manner are referred to as “unilateral effects ” A merger also can enhance market power by increasing the risk of coordinated, accommodating, or interdependent behavior among rivals Adverse competitive effects arising in this manner are referred to as “coordinated effects ” In any given case, either or both types of effects may be present, and the distinction between them may be blurred These Guidelines principally describe how the Agencies analyze mergers between rival suppliers that may enhance their market power as sellers Enhancement of market power by sellers often elevates the prices charged to customers For simplicity of exposition, these Guidelines generally discuss the analysis in terms of such price effects Enhanced market power can also be manifested in non-price terms and conditions that adversely affect customers, including reduced product quality, reduced product variety, reduced service, or diminished innovation Such non-price effects may coexist with price effects, or can arise in their absence When the Agencies investigate whether a merger may lead to a substantial lessening of non-price competition, they employ an approach analogous to that used to evaluate price competition Enhanced market power may also make it more likely that the merged entity can profitably and effectively engage in exclusionary conduct Regardless of how enhanced market power likely would be manifested, the Agencies normally evaluate mergers based on their impact on customers The Agencies examine effects on either or both of the direct customers and the final consumers The Agencies presume, absent convincing evidence to the contrary, that adverse effects on direct customers also cause adverse effects on final consumers Enhancement of market power by buyers, sometimes called “monopsony power,” has adverse effects comparable to enhancement of market power by sellers The Agencies employ an analogous framework to analyze mergers between rival purchasers that may enhance their market power as buyers See Section 12 2 Evidence of Adverse Competitive Effects The Agencies consider any reasonably available and reliable evidence to address the central question of whether a merger may substantially lessen competition This section discusses several categories and sources of evidence that the Agencies, in their experience, have found most informative in predicting the likely competitive effects of mergers The list provided here is not exhaustive In any given case, reliable evidence may be available in only some categories or from some sources For each category of evidence, the Agencies consider evidence indicating that the merger may enhance competition as well as evidence indicating that it may lessen competition 2       2 1 Types of Evidence 2 1 1 Actual Effects Observed in Consummated Mergers When evaluating a consummated merger, the ultimate issue is not only whether adverse competitive effects have already resulted from the merger, but also whether such effects are likely to arise in the future Evidence of observed post-merger price increases or other changes adverse to customers is given substantial weight The Agencies evaluate whether such changes are anticompetitive effects resulting from the merger, in which case they can be dispositive However, a consummated merger may be anticompetitive even if such effects have not yet been observed, perhaps because the merged firm may be aware of the possibility of post-merger antitrust review and moderating its conduct Consequently, the Agencies also consider the same types of evidence they consider when evaluating unconsummated mergers 2 1 2 Direct Comparisons Based on Experience The Agencies look for historical events, or “natural experiments,” that are informative regarding the competitive effects of the merger For example, the Agencies may examine the impact of recent mergers, entry, expansion, or exit in the relevant market Effects of analogous events in similar markets may also be informative The Agencies also look for reliable evidence based on variations among similar markets For example, if the merging firms compete in some locales but not others, comparisons of prices charged in regions where they do and do not compete may be informative regarding post-merger prices In some cases, however, prices are set on such a broad geographic basis that such comparisons are not informative The Agencies also may examine how prices in similar markets vary with the number of significant competitors in those markets 2 1 3 Market Shares and Concentration in a Relevant Market The Agencies give weight to the merging parties’ market shares in a relevant market, the level of concentration, and the change in concentration caused by the merger See Sections 4 and 5 Mergers that cause a significant increase in concentration and result in highly concentrated markets are presumed to be likely to enhance market power, but this presumption can be rebutted by persuasive evidence showing that the merger is unlikely to enhance market power 2 1 4 Substantial Head-to-Head Competition The Agencies consider whether the merging firms have been, or likely will become absent the merger, substantial head-to-head competitors Such evidence can be especially relevant for evaluating adverse unilateral effects, which result directly from the loss of that competition See Section 6 This evidence can also inform market definition See Section 4 2 1 5 Disruptive Role of a Merging Party The Agencies consider whether a merger may lessen competition by eliminating a “maverick” firm, i e , a firm that plays a disruptive role in the market to the benefit of customers For example, if one of the merging firms has a strong incumbency position and the other merging firm threatens to 3                      disrupt market conditions with a new technology or business model, their merger can involve the loss of actual or potential competition Likewise, one of the merging firms may have the incentive to take the lead in price cutting or other competitive conduct or to resist increases in industry prices A firm that may discipline prices based on its ability and incentive to expand production rapidly using available capacity also can be a maverick, as can a firm that has often resisted otherwise prevailing industry norms to cooperate on price setting or other terms of competition 2 2 Sources of Evidence The Agencies consider many sources of evidence in their merger analysis The most common sources of reasonably available and reliable evidence are the merging parties, customers, other industry participants, and industry observers 2 2 1 Merging Parties The Agencies typically obtain substantial information from the merging parties This information can take the form of documents, testimony, or data, and can consist of descriptions of competitively relevant conditions or reflect actual business conduct and decisions Documents created in the normal course are more probative than documents created as advocacy materials in merger review Documents describing industry conditions can be informative regarding the operation of the market and how a firm identifies and assesses its rivals, particularly when business decisions are made in reliance on the accuracy of those descriptions The business decisions taken by the merging firms also can be informative about industry conditions For example, if a firm sets price well above incremental cost, that normally indicates either that the firm believes its customers are not highly sensitive to price (not in itself of antitrust concern, see Section 4 1 33) or that the firm and its rivals are engaged in coordinated interaction (see Section 7) Incremental cost depends on the relevant increment in output as well as on the time period involved, and in the case of large increments and sustained changes in output it may include some costs that would be fixed for smaller increments of output or shorter time periods Explicit or implicit evidence that the merging parties intend to raise prices, reduce output or capacity, reduce product quality or variety, withdraw products or delay their introduction, or curtail research and development efforts after the merger, or explicit or implicit evidence that the ability to engage in such conduct motivated the merger, can be highly informative in evaluating the likely effects of a merger Likewise, the Agencies look for reliable evidence that the merger is likely to result in efficiencies The Agencies give careful consideration to the views of individuals whose responsibilities, expertise, and experience relating to the issues in question provide particular indicia of reliability The financial terms of the transaction may also be informative regarding competitive effects For example, a purchase price in excess of the acquired firm’s stand-alone market value may indicate that the acquiring firm is paying a premium because it expects to be able to reduce competition or to achieve efficiencies 3 High margins commonly arise for products that are significantly differentiated Products involving substantial fixed costs typically will be developed only if suppliers expect there to be enough differentiation to support margins sufficient to cover those fixed costs High margins can be consistent with incumbent firms earning competitive returns 4        2 2 2 Customers Customers can provide a variety of information to the Agencies, ranging from information about their own purchasing behavior and choices to their views about the effects of the merger itself Information from customers about how they would likely respond to a price increase, and the relative attractiveness of different products or suppliers, may be highly relevant, especially when corroborated by other evidence such as historical purchasing patterns and practices Customers also can provide valuable information about the impact of historical events such as entry by a new supplier The conclusions of well-informed and sophisticated customers on the likely impact of the merger itself can also help the Agencies investigate competitive effects, because customers typically feel the consequences of both competitively beneficial and competitively harmful mergers In evaluating such evidence, the Agencies are mindful that customers may oppose, or favor, a merger for reasons unrelated to the antitrust issues raised by that merger When some customers express concerns about the competitive effects of a merger while others view the merger as beneficial or neutral, the Agencies take account of this divergence in using the information provided by customers and consider the likely reasons for such divergence of views For example, if for regulatory reasons some customers cannot buy imported products, while others can, a merger between domestic suppliers may harm the former customers even if it leaves the more flexible customers unharmed See Section 3 When direct customers of the merging firms compete against one another in a downstream market, their interests may not be aligned with the interests of final consumers, especially if the direct customers expect to pass on any anticompetitive price increase A customer that is protected from adverse competitive effects by a long-term contract, or otherwise relatively immune from the merger’s harmful effects, may even welcome an anticompetitive merger that provides that customer with a competitive advantage over its downstream rivals Example 1 As a result of the merger, Customer C will experience a price increase for an input used in producing its final product, raising its costs Customer C’s rivals use this input more intensively than Customer C, and the same price increase applied to them will raise their costs more than it raises Customer C’s costs On balance, Customer C may benefit from the merger even though the merger involves a substantial lessening of competition 2 2 3 Other Industry Participants and Observers Suppliers, indirect customers, distributors, other industry participants, and industry analysts can also provide information helpful to a merger inquiry The interests of firms selling products complementary to those offered by the merging firms often are well aligned with those of customers, making their informed views valuable Information from firms that are rivals to the merging parties can help illuminate how the market operates The interests of rival firms often diverge from the interests of customers, since customers normally lose, but rival firms gain, if the merged entity raises its prices For that reason, the Agencies do not routinely rely on the overall views of rival firms regarding the competitive effects of the 5          merger However, rival firms may provide relevant facts, and even their overall views may be instructive, especially in cases where the Agencies are concerned that the merged entity may engage in exclusionary conduct Example 2 Merging Firms A and B operate in a market in which network effects are significant, implying that any firm’s product is significantly more valuable if it commands a large market share or if it is interconnected with others that in aggregate command such a share Prior to the merger, they and their rivals voluntarily interconnect with one another The merger would create an entity with a large enough share that a strategy of ending voluntary interconnection would have a dangerous probability of creating monopoly power in this market The interests of rivals and of consumers would be broadly aligned in preventing such a merger 3 Targeted Customers and Price Discrimination When examining possible adverse competitive effects from a merger, the Agencies consider whether those effects vary significantly for different customers purchasing the same or similar products Such differential impacts are possible when sellers can discriminate, e g , by profitably raising price to certain targeted customers but not to others The possibility of price discrimination influences market definition (see Section 4), the measurement of market shares (see Section 5), and the evaluation of competitive effects (see Sections 6 and 7) When price discrimination is feasible, adverse competitive effects on targeted customers can arise, even if such effects will not arise for other customers A price increase for targeted customers may be profitable even if a price increase for all customers would not be profitable because too many other customers would substitute away When discrimination is reasonably likely, the Agencies may evaluate competitive effects separately by type of customer The Agencies may have access to information unavailable to customers that is relevant to evaluating whether discrimination is reasonably likely For price discrimination to be feasible, two conditions typically must be met differential pricing and limited arbitrage First, the suppliers engaging in price discrimination must be able to price differently to targeted customers than to other customers This may involve identification of individual customers to which different prices are offered or offering different prices to different types of customers based on observable characteristics Example 3 Suppliers can distinguish large buyers from small buyers Large buyers are more likely than small buyers to self-supply in response to a significant price increase The merger may lead to price discrimination against small buyers, harming them, even if large buyers are not harmed Such discrimination can occur even if there is no discrete gap in size between the classes of large and small buyers In other cases, suppliers may be unable to distinguish among different types of customers but can offer multiple products that sort customers based on their purchase decisions Second, the targeted customers must not be able to defeat the price increase of concern by arbitrage, e g , by purchasing indirectly from or through other customers Arbitrage may be difficult if it would void warranties or make service more difficult or costly for customers Arbitrage is inherently impossible for many services Arbitrage between customers at different geographic locations may be 6      impractical due to transportation costs Arbitrage on a modest scale may be possible but sufficiently costly or limited that it would not deter or defeat a discriminatory pricing strategy 4 Market Definition When the Agencies identify a potential competitive concern with a horizontal merger, market definition plays two roles First, market definition helps specify the line of commerce and section of the country in which the competitive concern arises In any merger enforcement action, the Agencies will normally identify one or more relevant markets in which the merger may substantially lessen competition Second, market definition allows the Agencies to identify market participants and measure market shares and market concentration See Section 5 The measurement of market shares and market concentration is not an end in itself, but is useful to the extent it illuminates the merger’s likely competitive effects The Agencies’ analysis need not start with market definition Some of the analytical tools used by the Agencies to assess competitive effects do not rely on market definition, although evaluation of competitive alternatives available to customers is always necessary at some point in the analysis Evidence of competitive effects can inform market definition, just as market definition can be informative regarding competitive effects For example, evidence that a reduction in the number of significant rivals offering a group of products causes prices for those products to rise significantly can itself establish that those products form a relevant market Such evidence also may more directly predict the competitive effects of a merger, reducing the role of inferences from market definition and market shares Where analysis suggests alternative and reasonably plausible candidate markets, and where the resulting market shares lead to very different inferences regarding competitive effects, it is particularly valuable to examine more direct forms of evidence concerning those effects Market definition focuses solely on demand substitution factors, i e , on customers’ ability and willingness to substitute away from one product to another in response to a price increase or a corresponding non-price change such as a reduction in product quality or service The responsive actions of suppliers are also important in competitive analysis They are considered in these Guidelines in the sections addressing the identification of market participants, the measurement of market shares, the analysis of competitive effects, and entry Customers often confront a range of possible substitutes for the products of the merging firms Some substitutes may be closer, and others more distant, either geographically or in terms of product attributes and perceptions Additionally, customers may assess the proximity of different products differently When products or suppliers in different geographic areas are substitutes for one another to varying degrees, defining a market to include some substitutes and exclude others is inevitably a simplification that cannot capture the full variation in the extent to which different products compete against each other The principles of market definition outlined below seek to make this inevitable simplification as useful and informative as is practically possible Relevant markets need not have precise metes and bounds 7           Defining a market broadly to include relatively distant product or geographic substitutes can lead to misleading market shares This is because the competitive significance of distant substitutes is unlikely to be commensurate with their shares in a broad market Although excluding more distant substitutes from the market inevitably understates their competitive significance to some degree, doing so often provides a more accurate indicator of the competitive effects of the merger than would the alternative of including them and overstating their competitive significance as proportional to their shares in an expanded market Example 4 Firms A and B, sellers of two leading brands of motorcycles, propose to merge If Brand A motorcycle prices were to rise, some buyers would substitute to Brand B, and some others would substitute to cars However, motorcycle buyers see Brand B motorcycles as much more similar to Brand A motorcycles than are cars Far more cars are sold than motorcycles Evaluating shares in a market that includes cars would greatly underestimate the competitive significance of Brand B motorcycles in constraining Brand A’s prices and greatly overestimate the significance of cars Market shares of different products in narrowly defined markets are more likely to capture the relative competitive significance of these products, and often more accurately reflect competition between close substitutes As a result, properly defined antitrust markets often exclude some substitutes to which some customers might turn in the face of a price increase even if such substitutes provide alternatives for those customers However, a group of products is too narrow to constitute a relevant market if competition from products outside that group is so ample that even the complete elimination of competition within the group would not significantly harm either direct customers or downstream consumers The hypothetical monopolist test (see Section 4 1 1) is designed to ensure that candidate markets are not overly narrow in this respect The Agencies implement these principles of market definition flexibly when evaluating different possible candidate markets Relevant antitrust markets defined according to the hypothetical monopolist test are not always intuitive and may not align with how industry members use the term “market ” Section 4 1 describes the principles that apply to product market definition, and gives guidance on how the Agencies most often apply those principles Section 4 2 describes how the same principles apply to geographic market definition Although discussed separately for simplicity of exposition, the principles described in Sections 4 1 and 4 2 are combined to define a relevant market, which has both a product and a geographic dimension In particular, the hypothetical monopolist test is applied to a group of products together with a geographic region to determine a relevant market 4 1 Product Market Definition When a product sold by one merging firm (Product A) competes against one or more products sold by the other merging firm, the Agencies define a relevant product market around Product A to evaluate the importance of that competition Such a relevant product market consists of a group of substitute products including Product A Multiple relevant product markets may thus be identified 4 1 1 The Hypothetical Monopolist Test The Agencies employ the hypothetical monopolist test to evaluate whether groups of products in candidate markets are sufficiently broad to constitute relevant antitrust markets The Agencies use the 8                                     hypothetical monopolist test to identify a set of products that are reasonably interchangeable with a product sold by one of the merging firms The hypothetical monopolist test requires that a product market contain enough substitute products so that it could be subject to post-merger exercise of market power significantly exceeding that existing absent the merger Specifically, the test requires that a hypothetical profit-maximizing firm, not subject to price regulation, that was the only present and future seller of those products (“hypothetical monopolist”) likely would impose at least a small but significant and non-transitory increase in price (“SSNIP”) on at least one product in the market, including at least one product sold by one of the merging firms 4 For the purpose of analyzing this issue, the terms of sale of products outside the candidate market are held constant The SSNIP is employed solely as a methodological tool for performing the hypothetical monopolist test it is not a tolerance level for price increases resulting from a merger Groups of products may satisfy the hypothetical monopolist test without including the full range of substitutes from which customers choose The hypothetical monopolist test may identify a group of products as a relevant market even if customers would substitute significantly to products outside that group in response to a price increase Example 5 Products A and B are being tested as a candidate market Each sells for $100, has an incremental cost of $60, and sells 1200 units For every dollar increase in the price of Product A, for any given price of Product B, Product A loses twenty units of sales to products outside the candidate market and ten units of sales to Product B, and likewise for Product B Under these conditions, economic analysis shows that a hypothetical profit-maximizing monopolist controlling Products A and B would raise both of their prices by ten percent, to $110 Therefore, Products A and B satisfy the hypothetical monopolist test using a five percent SSNIP, and indeed for any SSNIP size up to ten percent This is true even though two-thirds of the sales lost by one product when it raises its price are diverted to products outside the relevant market When applying the hypothetical monopolist test to define a market around a product offered by one of the merging firms, if the market includes a second product, the Agencies will normally also include a third product if that third product is a closer substitute for the first product than is the second product The third product is a closer substitute if, in response to a SSNIP on the first product, greater revenues are diverted to the third product than to the second product Example 6 In Example 5, suppose that half of the unit sales lost by Product A when it raises its price are diverted to Product C, which also has a price of $100, while one-third are diverted to Product B Product C is a closer substitute for Product A than is Product B Thus Product C will normally be included in the relevant market, even though Products A and B together satisfy the hypothetical monopolist test The hypothetical monopolist test ensures that markets are not defined too narrowly, but it does not lead to a single relevant market The Agencies may evaluate a merger in any relevant market If the pricing incentives of the firms supplying the products in the candidate market differ substantially from those of the hypothetical monopolist, for reasons other than the latter’s control over a larger group of substitutes, the Agencies may instead employ the concept of a hypothetical profit-maximizing cartel comprised of the firms (with all their products) that sell the products in the candidate market This approach is most likely to be appropriate if the merging firms sell products outside the candidate market that significantly affect their pricing incentives for products in the candidate market This could occur, for example, if the candidate market is one for durable equipment and the firms selling that equipment derive substantial net revenues from selling spare parts and service for that equipment 9 4                          satisfying the test, guided by the overarching principle that the purpose of defining the market and measuring market shares is to illuminate the evaluation of competitive effects Because the relative competitive significance of more distant substitutes is apt to be overstated by their share of sales, when the Agencies rely on market shares and concentration, they usually do so in the smallest relevant market satisfying the hypothetical monopolist test Example 7 In Example 4, including cars in the market will lead to misleadingly small market shares for motorcycle producers Unless motorcycles fail the hypothetical monopolist test, the Agencies would not include cars in the market in analyzing this motorcycle merger 4 1 2 Benchmark Prices and SSNIP Size The Agencies apply the SSNIP starting from prices that would likely prevail absent the merger If prices are not likely to change absent the merger, these benchmark prices can reasonably be taken to be the prices prevailing prior to the merger 5 If prices are likely to change absent the merger, e g , because of innovation or entry, the Agencies may use anticipated future prices as the benchmark for the test If prices might fall absent the merger due to the breakdown of pre-merger coordination, the Agencies may use those lower prices as the benchmark for the test In some cases, the techniques employed by the Agencies to implement the hypothetical monopolist test focus on the difference in incentives between pre-merger firms and the hypothetical monopolist and do not require specifying the benchmark prices The SSNIP is intended to represent a “small but significant” increase in the prices charged by firms in the candidate market for the value they contribute to the products or services used by customers This properly directs attention to the effects of price changes commensurate with those that might result from a significant lessening of competition caused by the merger This methodology is used because normally it is possible to quantify “small but significant” adverse price effects on customers and analyze their likely reactions, not because price effects are more important than non-price effects The Agencies most often use a SSNIP of five percent of the price paid by customers for the products or services to which the merging firms contribute value However, what constitutes a “small but significant” increase in price, commensurate with a significant loss of competition caused by the merger, depends upon the nature of the industry and the merging firms’ positions in it, and the Agencies may accordingly use a price increase that is larger or smaller than five percent Where explicit or implicit prices for the firms’ specific contribution to value can be identified with reasonable clarity, the Agencies may base the SSNIP on those prices Example 8 In a merger between two oil pipelines, the SSNIP would be based on the price charged for transporting the oil, not on the price of the oil itself If pipelines buy the oil at one end and sell it at the other, the price charged for transporting the oil is implicit, equal to the difference between the price paid for oil at the input end and the price charged for oil at the output end The relevant product sold by the pipelines is better described as “pipeline transportation of oil from point A to point B” than as “oil at point B ” Market definition for the evaluation of non-merger antitrust concerns such as monopolization or facilitating practices will differ in this respect if the effects resulting from the conduct of concern are already occurring at the time of evaluation 10 5                    Example 9 In a merger between two firms that install computers purchased from third parties, the SSNIP would be based on their fees, not on the price of installed computers If these firms purchase the computers and charge their customers one package price, the implicit installation fee is equal to the package charge to customers less the price of the computers Example 10 In Example 9, suppose that the prices paid by the merging firms to purchase computers are opaque, but account for at least ninety-five percent of the prices they charge for installed computers, with profits or implicit fees making up five percent of those prices at most A five percent SSNIP on the total price paid by customers would at least double those fees or profits Even if that would be unprofitable for a hypothetical monopolist, a significant increase in fees might well be profitable If the SSNIP is based on the total price paid by customers, a lower percentage will be used 4 1 3 Implementing the Hypothetical Monopolist Test The hypothetical monopolist’s incentive to raise prices depends both on the extent to which customers would likely substitute away from the products in the candidate market in response to such a price increase and on the profit margins earned on those products The profit margin on incremental units is the difference between price and incremental cost on those units The Agencies often estimate incremental costs, for example using merging parties’ documents or data the merging parties use to make business decisions Incremental cost is measured over the change in output that would be caused by the price increase under consideration In considering customers’ likely responses to higher prices, the Agencies take into account any reasonably available and reliable evidence, including, but not limited to  how customers have shifted purchases in the past in response to relative changes in price or other terms and conditions  information from buyers, including surveys, concerning how they would respond to price changes  the conduct of industry participants, notably o sellers’ business decisions or business documents indicating sellers’ informed beliefs concerning how customers would substitute among products in response to relative changes in price o industry participants’ behavior in tracking and responding to price changes by some or all rivals  objective information about product characteristics and the costs and delays of switching products, especially switching from products in the candidate market to products outside the candidate market  the percentage of sales lost by one product in the candidate market, when its price alone rises, that is recaptured by other products in the candidate market, with a higher recapture percentage making a price increase more profitable for the hypothetical monopolist  evidence from other industry participants, such as sellers of complementary products 11                       legal or regulatory requirements and  the influence of downstream competition faced by customers in their output markets When the necessary data are available, the Agencies also may consider a “critical loss analysis” to assess the extent to which it corroborates inferences drawn from the evidence noted above Critical loss analysis asks whether imposing at least a SSNIP on one or more products in a candidate market would raise or lower the hypothetical monopolist’s profits While this “breakeven” analysis differs from the profit-maximizing analysis called for by the hypothetical monopolist test in Section 4 1 1, merging parties sometimes present this type of analysis to the Agencies A price increase raises profits on sales made at the higher price, but this will be offset to the extent customers substitute away from products in the candidate market Critical loss analysis compares the magnitude of these two offsetting effects resulting from the price increase The “critical loss” is defined as the number of lost unit sales that would leave profits unchanged The “predicted loss” is defined as the number of unit sales that the hypothetical monopolist is predicted to lose due to the price increase The price increase raises the hypothetical monopolist’s profits if the predicted loss is less than the critical loss The Agencies consider all of the evidence of customer substitution noted above in assessing the predicted loss The Agencies require that estimates of the predicted loss be consistent with that evidence, including the pre-merger margins of products in the candidate market used to calculate the critical loss Unless the firms are engaging in coordinated interaction (see Section 7), high pre-merger margins normally indicate that each firm’s product individually faces demand that is not highly sensitive to price 6 Higher pre-merger margins thus indicate a smaller predicted loss as well as a smaller critical loss The higher the pre-merger margin, the smaller the recapture percentage necessary for the candidate market to satisfy the hypothetical monopolist test Even when the evidence necessary to perform the hypothetical monopolist test quantitatively is not available, the conceptual framework of the test provides a useful methodological tool for gathering and analyzing evidence pertinent to customer substitution and to market definition The Agencies follow the hypothetical monopolist test to the extent possible given the available evidence, bearing in mind that the ultimate goal of market definition is to help determine whether the merger may substantially lessen competition 4 1 4 Product Market Definition with Targeted Customers If a hypothetical monopolist could profitably target a subset of customers for price increases, the Agencies may identify relevant markets defined around those targeted customers, to whom a hypothetical monopolist would profitably and separately impose at least a SSNIP Markets to serve targeted customers are also known as price discrimination markets In practice, the Agencies identify price discrimination markets only where they believe there is a realistic prospect of an adverse competitive effect on a group of targeted customers Example 11 Glass containers have many uses In response to a price increase for glass containers, some users would substitute substantially to plastic or metal containers, but baby food manufacturers would not If a 6 While margins are important for implementing the hypothetical monopolist test, high margins are not in themselves of antitrust concern 12     hypothetical monopolist could price separately and limit arbitrage, baby food manufacturers would be vulnerable to a targeted increase in the price of glass containers The Agencies could define a distinct market for glass containers used to package baby food The Agencies also often consider markets for targeted customers when prices are individually negotiated and suppliers have information about customers that would allow a hypothetical monopolist to identify customers that are likely to pay a higher price for the relevant product If prices are negotiated individually with customers, the hypothetical monopolist test may suggest relevant markets that are as narrow as individual customers (see also Section 6 2 on bargaining and auctions) Nonetheless, the Agencies often define markets for groups of targeted customers, i e , by type of customer, rather than by individual customer By so doing, the Agencies are able to rely on aggregated market shares that can be more helpful in predicting the competitive effects of the merger 4 2 Geographic Market Definition The arena of competition affected by the merger may be geographically bounded if geography limits some customers’ willingness or ability to substitute to some products, or some suppliers’ willingness or ability to serve some customers Both supplier and customer locations can affect this The Agencies apply the principles of market definition described here and in Section 4 1 to define a relevant market with a geographic dimension as well as a product dimension The scope of geographic markets often depends on transportation costs Other factors such as language, regulation, tariff and non-tariff trade barriers, custom and familiarity, reputation, and service availability may impede long-distance or international transactions The competitive significance of foreign firms may be assessed at various exchange rates, especially if exchange rates have fluctuated in the recent past In the absence of price discrimination based on customer location, the Agencies normally define geographic markets based on the locations of suppliers, as explained in subsection 4 2 1 In other cases, notably if price discrimination based on customer location is feasible as is often the case when delivered pricing is commonly used in the industry, the Agencies may define geographic markets based on the locations of customers, as explained in subsection 4 2 2 4 2 1 Geographic Markets Based on the Locations of Suppliers Geographic markets based on the locations of suppliers encompass the region from which sales are made Geographic markets of this type often apply when customers receive goods or services at suppliers’ locations Competitors in the market are firms with relevant production, sales, or service facilities in that region Some customers who buy from these firms may be located outside the boundaries of the geographic market The hypothetical monopolist test requires that a hypothetical profit-maximizing firm that was the only present or future producer of the relevant product(s) located in the region would impose at least a SSNIP from at least one location, including at least one location of one of the merging firms In this exercise the terms of sale for all products produced elsewhere are held constant A single firm may operate in a number of different geographic markets, even for a single product 13                          Example 12 The merging parties both have manufacturing plants in City X The relevant product is expensive to transport and suppliers price their products for pickup at their locations Rival plants are some distance away in City Y A hypothetical monopolist controlling all plants in City X could profitably impose a SSNIP at these plants Competition from more distant plants would not defeat the price increase because supplies coming from more distant plants require expensive transportation The relevant geographic market is defined around the plants in City X When the geographic market is defined based on supplier locations, sales made by suppliers located in the geographic market are counted, regardless of the location of the customer making the purchase In considering likely reactions of customers to price increases for the relevant product(s) imposed in a candidate geographic market, the Agencies consider any reasonably available and reliable evidence, including  how customers have shifted purchases in the past between different geographic locations in response to relative changes in price or other terms and conditions  the cost and difficulty of transporting the product (or the cost and difficulty of a customer traveling to a seller’s location), in relation to its price  whether suppliers need a presence near customers to provide service or support  evidence on whether sellers base business decisions on the prospect of customers switching between geographic locations in response to relative changes in price or other competitive variables  the costs and delays of switching from suppliers in the candidate geographic market to suppliers outside the candidate geographic market and  the influence of downstream competition faced by customers in their output markets 4 2 2 Geographic Markets Based on the Locations of Customers When the hypothetical monopolist could discriminate based on customer location, the Agencies may define geographic markets based on the locations of targeted customers 7 Geographic markets of this type often apply when suppliers deliver their products or services to customers’ locations Geographic markets of this type encompass the region into which sales are made Competitors in the market are firms that sell to customers in the specified region Some suppliers that sell into the relevant market may be located outside the boundaries of the geographic market The hypothetical monopolist test requires that a hypothetical profit-maximizing firm that was the only present or future seller of the relevant product(s) to customers in the region would impose at least a SSNIP on some customers in that region A region forms a relevant geographic market if this price increase would not be defeated by substitution away from the relevant product or by arbitrage, 7 For customers operating in multiple locations, only those customer locations within the targeted zone are included in the market 14                 e g , customers in the region travelling outside it to purchase the relevant product In this exercise, the terms of sale for products sold to all customers outside the region are held constant Example 13 Customers require local sales and support Suppliers have sales and service operations in many geographic areas and can discriminate based on customer location The geographic market can be defined around the locations of customers Example 14 Each merging firm has a single manufacturing plant and delivers the relevant product to customers in City X and in City Y The relevant product is expensive to transport The merging firms’ plants are by far the closest to City X, but no closer to City Y than are numerous rival plants This fact pattern suggests that customers in City X may be harmed by the merger even if customers in City Y are not For that reason, the Agencies consider a relevant geographic market defined around customers in City X Such a market could be defined even if the region around the merging firms’ plants would not be a relevant geographic market defined based on the location of sellers because a hypothetical monopolist controlling all plants in that region would find a SSNIP imposed on all of its customers unprofitable due to the loss of sales to customers in City Y When the geographic market is defined based on customer locations, sales made to those customers are counted, regardless of the location of the supplier making those sales Example 15 Customers in the United States must use products approved by U S regulators Foreign customers use products not approved by U S regulators The relevant product market consists of products approved by U S regulators The geographic market is defined around U S customers Any sales made to U S customers by foreign suppliers are included in the market, and those foreign suppliers are participants in the U S market even though located outside it 5 Market Participants, Market Shares, and Market Concentration The Agencies normally consider measures of market shares and market concentration as part of their evaluation of competitive effects The Agencies evaluate market shares and concentration in conjunction with other reasonably available and reliable evidence for the ultimate purpose of determining whether a merger may substantially lessen competition Market shares can directly influence firms’ competitive incentives For example, if a price reduction to gain new customers would also apply to a firm’s existing customers, a firm with a large market share may be more reluctant to implement a price reduction than one with a small share Likewise, a firm with a large market share may not feel pressure to reduce price even if a smaller rival does Market shares also can reflect firms’ capabilities For example, a firm with a large market share may be able to expand output rapidly by a larger absolute amount than can a small firm Similarly, a large market share tends to indicate low costs, an attractive product, or both Market Participants All firms that currently earn revenues in the relevant market are considered market participants Vertically integrated firms are also included to the extent that their inclusion accurately reflects their competitive significance Firms not currently earning revenues in the relevant market, but that have committed to entering the market in the near future, are also considered market participants Firms that are not current producers in a relevant market, but that would very likely provide rapid supply responses with direct competitive impact in the event of a SSNIP, without incurring 15 5 1                        significant sunk costs, are also considered market participants These firms are termed “rapid entrants ” Sunk costs are entry or exit costs that cannot be recovered outside the relevant market Entry that would take place more slowly in response to adverse competitive effects, or that requires firms to incur significant sunk costs, is considered in Section 9 Firms that produce the relevant product but do not sell it in the relevant geographic market may be rapid entrants Other things equal, such firms are most likely to be rapid entrants if they are close to the geographic market Example 16 Farm A grows tomatoes halfway between Cities X and Y Currently, it ships its tomatoes to City X because prices there are two percent higher Previously it has varied the destination of its shipments in response to small price variations Farm A would likely be a rapid entrant participant in a market for tomatoes in City Y Example 17 Firm B has bid multiple times to supply milk to School District S, and actually supplies milk to schools in some adjacent areas It has never won a bid in School District S, but is well qualified to serve that district and has often nearly won Firm B would be counted as a rapid entrant in a market for school milk in School District S More generally, if the relevant market is defined around targeted customers, firms that produce relevant products but do not sell them to those customers may be rapid entrants if they can easily and rapidly begin selling to the targeted customers Firms that clearly possess the necessary assets to supply into the relevant market rapidly may also be rapid entrants In markets for relatively homogeneous goods where a supplier’s ability to compete depends predominantly on its costs and its capacity, and not on other factors such as experience or reputation in the relevant market, a supplier with efficient idle capacity, or readily available “swing” capacity currently used in adjacent markets that can easily and profitably be shifted to serve the relevant market, may be a rapid entrant 8 However, idle capacity may be inefficient, and capacity used in adjacent markets may not be available, so a firm’s possession of idle or swing capacity alone does not make that firm a rapid entrant 5 2 Market Shares The Agencies normally calculate market shares for all firms that currently produce products in the relevant market, subject to the availability of data The Agencies also calculate market shares for other market participants if this can be done to reliably reflect their competitive significance Market concentration and market share data are normally based on historical evidence However, recent or ongoing changes in market conditions may indicate that the current market share of a particular firm either understates or overstates the firm’s future competitive significance The Agencies consider reasonably predictable effects of recent or ongoing changes in market conditions when calculating and interpreting market share data For example, if a new technology that is important to long-term competitive viability is available to other firms in the market, but is not available to a particular firm, the Agencies may conclude that that firm’s historical market share 8 If this type of supply side substitution is nearly universal among the firms selling one or more of a group of products, the Agencies may use an aggregate description of markets for those products as a matter of convenience 16        overstates its future competitive significance The Agencies may project historical market shares into the foreseeable future when this can be done reliably The Agencies measure market shares based on the best available indicator of firms’ future competitive significance in the relevant market This may depend upon the type of competitive effect being considered, and on the availability of data Typically, annual data are used, but where individual transactions are large and infrequent so annual data may be unrepresentative, the Agencies may measure market shares over a longer period of time In most contexts, the Agencies measure each firm’s market share based on its actual or projected revenues in the relevant market Revenues in the relevant market tend to be the best measure of attractiveness to customers, since they reflect the real-world ability of firms to surmount all of the obstacles necessary to offer products on terms and conditions that are attractive to customers In cases where one unit of a low-priced product can substitute for one unit of a higher-priced product, unit sales may measure competitive significance better than revenues For example, a new, much less expensive product may have great competitive significance if it substantially erodes the revenues earned by older, higher-priced products, even if it earns relatively few revenues In cases where customers sign long-term contracts, face switching costs, or tend to re-evaluate their suppliers only occasionally, revenues earned from recently acquired customers may better reflect the competitive significance of suppliers than do total revenues In markets for homogeneous products, a firm’s competitive significance may derive principally from its ability and incentive to rapidly expand production in the relevant market in response to a price increase or output reduction by others in that market As a result, a firm’s competitive significance may depend upon its level of readily available capacity to serve the relevant market if that capacity is efficient enough to make such expansion profitable In such markets, capacities or reserves may better reflect the future competitive significance of suppliers than revenues, and the Agencies may calculate market shares using those measures Market participants that are not current producers may then be assigned positive market shares, but only if a measure of their competitive significance properly comparable to that of current producers is available When market shares are measured based on firms’ readily available capacities, the Agencies do not include capacity that is committed or so profitably employed outside the relevant market, or so high-cost, that it would not likely be used to respond to a SSNIP in the relevant market Example 18 The geographic market is defined around customers in the United States Firm X produces the relevant product outside the United States, and most of its sales are made to customers outside the United States In most contexts, Firm X’s market share will be based on its sales to U S customers, not its total sales or total capacity However, if the relevant product is homogeneous, and if Firm X would significantly expand sales to U S customers rapidly and without incurring significant sunk costs in response to a SSNIP, the Agencies may base Firm X’s market share on its readily available capacity to serve U S customers When the Agencies define markets serving targeted customers, these same principles are used to measure market shares, as they apply to those customers In most contexts, each firm’s market share is based on its actual or projected revenues from the targeted customers However, the Agencies may instead measure market shares based on revenues from a broader group of customers if doing so would more accurately reflect the competitive significance of different suppliers in the relevant market Revenues earned from a broader group of customers may also be used when better data are thereby available 17                      5 3 Market Concentration Market concentration is often one useful indicator of likely competitive effects of a merger In evaluating market concentration, the Agencies consider both the post-merger level of market concentration and the change in concentration resulting from a merger Market shares may not fully reflect the competitive significance of firms in the market or the impact of a merger They are used in conjunction with other evidence of competitive effects See Sections 6 and 7 In analyzing mergers between an incumbent and a recent or potential entrant, to the extent the Agencies use the change in concentration to evaluate competitive effects, they will do so using projected market shares A merger between an incumbent and a potential entrant can raise significant competitive concerns The lessening of competition resulting from such a merger is more likely to be substantial, the larger is the market share of the incumbent, the greater is the competitive significance of the potential entrant, and the greater is the competitive threat posed by this potential entrant relative to others The Agencies give more weight to market concentration when market shares have been stable over time, especially in the face of historical changes in relative prices or costs If a firm has retained its market share even after its price has increased relative to those of its rivals, that firm already faces limited competitive constraints, making it less likely that its remaining rivals will replace the competition lost if one of that firm’s important rivals is eliminated due to a merger By contrast, even a highly concentrated market can be very competitive if market shares fluctuate substantially over short periods of time in response to changes in competitive offerings However, if competition by one of the merging firms has significantly contributed to these fluctuations, perhaps because it has acted as a maverick, the Agencies will consider whether the merger will enhance market power by combining that firm with one of its significant rivals The Agencies may measure market concentration using the number of significant competitors in the market This measure is most useful when there is a gap in market share between significant competitors and smaller rivals or when it is difficult to measure revenues in the relevant market The Agencies also may consider the combined market share of the merging firms as an indicator of the extent to which others in the market may not be able readily to replace competition between the merging firms that is lost through the merger The Agencies often calculate the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (“HHI”) of market concentration The HHI is calculated by summing the squares of the individual firms’ market shares,9 and thus gives proportionately greater weight to the larger market shares When using the HHI, the Agencies For example, a market consisting of four firms with market shares of thirty percent, thirty percent, twenty percent, and twenty percent has an HHI of 2600 (302 + 302 + 202 + 202 = 2600) The HHI ranges from 10,000 (in the case of a pure monopoly) to a number approaching zero (in the case of an atomistic market) Although it is desirable to include all firms in the calculation, lack of information about firms with small shares is not critical because such firms do not affect the HHI significantly 18 9                        consider both the post-merger level of the HHI and the increase in the HHI resulting from the merger The increase in the HHI is equal to twice the product of the market shares of the merging firms 10 Based on their experience, the Agencies generally classify markets into three types  Unconcentrated Markets HHI below 1500  Moderately Concentrated Markets HHI between 1500 and 2500  Highly Concentrated Markets HHI above 2500 The Agencies employ the following general standards for the relevant markets they have defined  Small Change in Concentration Mergers involving an increase in the HHI of less than 100 points are unlikely to have adverse competitive effects and ordinarily require no further analysis  Unconcentrated Markets Mergers resulting in unconcentrated markets are unlikely to have adverse competitive effects and ordinarily require no further analysis  Moderately Concentrated Markets Mergers resulting in moderately concentrated markets that involve an increase in the HHI of more than 100 points potentially raise significant competitive concerns and often warrant scrutiny  Highly Concentrated Markets Mergers resulting in highly concentrated markets that involve an increase in the HHI of between 100 points and 200 points potentially raise significant competitive concerns and often warrant scrutiny Mergers resulting in highly concentrated markets that involve an increase in the HHI of more than 200 points will be presumed to be likely to enhance market power The presumption may be rebutted by persuasive evidence showing that the merger is unlikely to enhance market power The purpose of these thresholds is not to provide a rigid screen to separate competitively benign mergers from anticompetitive ones, although high levels of concentration do raise concerns Rather, they provide one way to identify some mergers unlikely to raise competitive concerns and some others for which it is particularly important to examine whether other competitive factors confirm, reinforce, or counteract the potentially harmful effects of increased concentration The higher the post-merger HHI and the increase in the HHI, the greater are the Agencies’ potential competitive concerns and the greater is the likelihood that the Agencies will request additional information to conduct their analysis 10 For example, the merger of firms with shares of five percent and ten percent of the market would increase the HHI by 100 (5 × 10 × 2 = 100) 19   6 1 6 Unilateral Effects The elimination of competition between two firms that results from their merger may alone constitute a substantial lessening of competition Such unilateral effects are most apparent in a merger to monopoly in a relevant market, but are by no means limited to that case Whether cognizable efficiencies resulting from the merger are likely to reduce or reverse adverse unilateral effects is addressed in Section 10 Several common types of unilateral effects are discussed in this section Section 6 1 discusses unilateral price effects in markets with differentiated products Section 6 2 discusses unilateral effects in markets where sellers negotiate with buyers or prices are determined through auctions Section 6 3 discusses unilateral effects relating to reductions in output or capacity in markets for relatively homogeneous products Section 6 4 discusses unilateral effects arising from diminished innovation or reduced product variety These effects do not exhaust the types of possible unilateral effects for example, exclusionary unilateral effects also can arise A merger may result in different unilateral effects along different dimensions of competition For example, a merger may increase prices in the short term but not raise longer-term concerns about innovation, either because rivals will provide sufficient innovation competition or because the merger will generate cognizable research and development efficiencies See Section 10 Pricing of Differentiated Products In differentiated product industries, some products can be very close substitutes and compete strongly with each other, while other products are more distant substitutes and compete less strongly For example, one high-end product may compete much more directly with another high-end product than with any low-end product A merger between firms selling differentiated products may diminish competition by enabling the merged firm to profit by unilaterally raising the price of one or both products above the pre-merger level Some of the sales lost due to the price rise will merely be diverted to the product of the merger partner and, depending on relative margins, capturing such sales loss through merger may make the price increase profitable even though it would not have been profitable prior to the merger The extent of direct competition between the products sold by the merging parties is central to the evaluation of unilateral price effects Unilateral price effects are greater, the more the buyers of products sold by one merging firm consider products sold by the other merging firm to be their next choice The Agencies consider any reasonably available and reliable information to evaluate the extent of direct competition between the products sold by the merging firms This includes documentary and testimonial evidence, win/loss reports and evidence from discount approval processes, customer switching patterns, and customer surveys The types of evidence relied on often overlap substantially with the types of evidence of customer substitution relevant to the hypothetical monopolist test See Section 4 1 1 Substantial unilateral price elevation post-merger for a product formerly sold by one of the merging firms normally requires that a significant fraction of the customers purchasing that product view 20                         products formerly sold by the other merging firm as their next-best choice However, unless premerger margins between price and incremental cost are low, that significant fraction need not approach a majority For this purpose, incremental cost is measured over the change in output that would be caused by the price change considered A merger may produce significant unilateral effects for a given product even though many more sales are diverted to products sold by non-merging firms than to products previously sold by the merger partner Example 19 In Example 5, the merged entity controlling Products A and B would raise prices ten percent, given the product offerings and prices of other firms In that example, one-third of the sales lost by Product A when its price alone is raised are diverted to Product B Further analysis is required to account for repositioning, entry, and efficiencies In some cases, the Agencies may seek to quantify the extent of direct competition between a product sold by one merging firm and a second product sold by the other merging firm by estimating the diversion ratio from the first product to the second product The diversion ratio is the fraction of unit sales lost by the first product due to an increase in its price that would be diverted to the second product Diversion ratios between products sold by one merging firm and products sold by the other merging firm can be very informative for assessing unilateral price effects, with higher diversion ratios indicating a greater likelihood of such effects Diversion ratios between products sold by merging firms and those sold by non-merging firms have at most secondary predictive value Adverse unilateral price effects can arise when the merger gives the merged entity an incentive to raise the price of a product previously sold by one merging firm and thereby divert sales to products previously sold by the other merging firm, boosting the profits on the latter products Taking as given other prices and product offerings, that boost to profits is equal to the value to the merged firm of the sales diverted to those products The value of sales diverted to a product is equal to the number of units diverted to that product multiplied by the margin between price and incremental cost on that product In some cases, where sufficient information is available, the Agencies assess the value of diverted sales, which can serve as an indicator of the upward pricing pressure on the first product resulting from the merger Diagnosing unilateral price effects based on the value of diverted sales need not rely on market definition or the calculation of market shares and concentration The Agencies rely much more on the value of diverted sales than on the level of the HHI for diagnosing unilateral price effects in markets with differentiated products If the value of diverted sales is proportionately small, significant unilateral price effects are unlikely 11 Where sufficient data are available, the Agencies may construct economic models designed to quantify the unilateral price effects resulting from the merger These models often include independent price responses by non-merging firms They also can incorporate merger-specific efficiencies These merger simulation methods need not rely on market definition The Agencies do not treat merger simulation evidence as conclusive in itself, and they place more weight on whether their merger simulations consistently predict substantial price increases than on the precise prediction of any single simulation 11 For this purpose, the value of diverted sales is measured in proportion to the lost revenues attributable to the reduction in unit sales resulting from the price increase Those lost revenues equal the reduction in the number of units sold of that product multiplied by that product’s price 21     A merger is unlikely to generate substantial unilateral price increases if non-merging parties offer very close substitutes for the products offered by the merging firms In some cases, non-merging firms may be able to reposition their products to offer close substitutes for the products offered by the merging firms Repositioning is a supply-side response that is evaluated much like entry, with consideration given to timeliness, likelihood, and sufficiency See Section 9 The Agencies consider whether repositioning would be sufficient to deter or counteract what otherwise would be significant anticompetitive unilateral effects from a differentiated products merger 6 2 Bargaining and Auctions In many industries, especially those involving intermediate goods and services, buyers and sellers negotiate to determine prices and other terms of trade In that process, buyers commonly negotiate with more than one seller, and may play sellers off against one another Some highly structured forms of such competition are known as auctions Negotiations often combine aspects of an auction with aspects of one-on-one negotiation, although pure auctions are sometimes used in government procurement and elsewhere A merger between two competing sellers prevents buyers from playing those sellers off against each other in negotiations This alone can significantly enhance the ability and incentive of the merged entity to obtain a result more favorable to it, and less favorable to the buyer, than the merging firms would have offered separately absent the merger The Agencies analyze unilateral effects of this type using similar approaches to those described in Section 6 1 Anticompetitive unilateral effects in these settings are likely in proportion to the frequency or probability with which, prior to the merger, one of the merging sellers had been the runner-up when the other won the business These effects also are likely to be greater, the greater advantage the runner-up merging firm has over other suppliers in meeting customers’ needs These effects also tend to be greater, the more profitable were the pre-merger winning bids All of these factors are likely to be small if there are many equally placed bidders The mechanisms of these anticompetitive unilateral effects, and the indicia of their likelihood, differ somewhat according to the bargaining practices used, the auction format, and the sellers’ information about one another’s costs and about buyers’ preferences For example, when the merging sellers are likely to know which buyers they are best and second best placed to serve, any anticompetitive unilateral effects are apt to be targeted at those buyers when sellers are less well informed, such effects are more apt to be spread over a broader class of buyers 6 3 Capacity and Output for Homogeneous Products In markets involving relatively undifferentiated products, the Agencies may evaluate whether the merged firm will find it profitable unilaterally to suppress output and elevate the market price A firm may leave capacity idle, refrain from building or obtaining capacity that would have been obtained absent the merger, or eliminate pre-existing production capabilities A firm may also divert the use of capacity away from one relevant market and into another so as to raise the price in the former market The competitive analyses of these alternative modes of output suppression may differ 22                        6 4 A unilateral output suppression strategy is more likely to be profitable when (1) the merged firm’s market share is relatively high (2) the share of the merged firm’s output already committed for sale at prices unaffected by the output suppression is relatively low (3) the margin on the suppressed output is relatively low (4) the supply responses of rivals are relatively small and (5) the market elasticity of demand is relatively low A merger may provide the merged firm a larger base of sales on which to benefit from the resulting price rise, or it may eliminate a competitor that otherwise could have expanded its output in response to the price rise Example 20 Firms A and B both produce an industrial commodity and propose to merge The demand for this commodity is insensitive to price Firm A is the market leader Firm B produces substantial output, but its operating margins are low because it operates high-cost plants The other suppliers are operating very near capacity The merged firm has an incentive to reduce output at the high-cost plants, perhaps shutting down some of that capacity, thus driving up the price it receives on the remainder of its output The merger harms customers, notwithstanding that the merged firm shifts some output from high-cost plants to low-cost plants In some cases, a merger between a firm with a substantial share of the sales in the market and a firm with significant excess capacity to serve that market can make an output suppression strategy profitable 12 This can occur even if the firm with the excess capacity has a relatively small share of sales, if that firm’s ability to expand, and thus keep price from rising, has been making an output suppression strategy unprofitable for the firm with the larger market share Innovation and Product Variety Competition often spurs firms to innovate The Agencies may consider whether a merger is likely to diminish innovation competition by encouraging the merged firm to curtail its innovative efforts below the level that would prevail in the absence of the merger That curtailment of innovation could take the form of reduced incentive to continue with an existing product-development effort or reduced incentive to initiate development of new products The first of these effects is most likely to occur if at least one of the merging firms is engaging in efforts to introduce new products that would capture substantial revenues from the other merging firm The second, longer-run effect is most likely to occur if at least one of the merging firms has capabilities that are likely to lead it to develop new products in the future that would capture substantial revenues from the other merging firm The Agencies therefore also consider whether a merger will diminish innovation competition by combining two of a very small number of firms with the strongest capabilities to successfully innovate in a specific direction The Agencies evaluate the extent to which successful innovation by one merging firm is likely to take sales from the other, and the extent to which post-merger incentives for future innovation will be lower than those that would prevail in the absence of the merger The Agencies also consider whether the merger is likely to enable innovation that would not otherwise take place, by bringing together 12 Such a merger also can cause adverse coordinated effects, especially if the acquired firm with excess capacity was disrupting effective coordination 23          complementary capabilities that cannot be otherwise combined or for some other merger-specific reason See Section 10 The Agencies also consider whether a merger is likely to give the merged firm an incentive to cease offering one of the relevant products sold by the merging parties Reductions in variety following a merger may or may not be anticompetitive Mergers can lead to the efficient consolidation of products when variety offers little in value to customers In other cases, a merger may increase variety by encouraging the merged firm to reposition its products to be more differentiated from one another If the merged firm would withdraw a product that a significant number of customers strongly prefer to those products that would remain available, this can constitute a harm to customers over and above any effects on the price or quality of any given product If there is evidence of such an effect, the Agencies may inquire whether the reduction in variety is largely due to a loss of competitive incentives attributable to the merger An anticompetitive incentive to eliminate a product as a result of the merger is greater and more likely, the larger is the share of profits from that product coming at the expense of profits from products sold by the merger partner Where a merger substantially reduces competition by bringing two close substitute products under common ownership, and one of those products is eliminated, the merger will often also lead to a price increase on the remaining product, but that is not a necessary condition for anticompetitive effect Example 21 Firm A sells a high-end product at a premium price Firm B sells a mid-range product at a lower price, serving customers who are more price sensitive Several other firms have low-end products Firms A and B together have a large share of the relevant market Firm A proposes to acquire Firm B and discontinue Firm B’s product Firm A expects to retain most of Firm B’s customers Firm A may not find it profitable to raise the price of its high-end product after the merger, because doing so would reduce its ability to retain Firm B’s more price-sensitive customers The Agencies may conclude that the withdrawal of Firm B’s product results from a loss of competition and materially harms customers 7 Coordinated Effects A merger may diminish competition by enabling or encouraging post-merger coordinated interaction among firms in the relevant market that harms customers Coordinated interaction involves conduct by multiple firms that is profitable for each of them only as a result of the accommodating reactions of the others These reactions can blunt a firm’s incentive to offer customers better deals by undercutting the extent to which such a move would win business away from rivals They also can enhance a firm’s incentive to raise prices, by assuaging the fear that such a move would lose customers to rivals Coordinated interaction includes a range of conduct Coordinated interaction can involve the explicit negotiation of a common understanding of how firms will compete or refrain from competing Such conduct typically would itself violate the antitrust laws Coordinated interaction also can involve a similar common understanding that is not explicitly negotiated but would be enforced by the detection and punishment of deviations that would undermine the coordinated interaction Coordinated interaction alternatively can involve parallel accommodating conduct not pursuant to a prior understanding Parallel accommodating conduct includes situations in which each rival’s response to competitive moves made by others is individually rational, and not motivated by 24    retaliation or deterrence nor intended to sustain an agreed-upon market outcome, but nevertheless emboldens price increases and weakens competitive incentives to reduce prices or offer customers better terms Coordinated interaction includes conduct not otherwise condemned by the antitrust laws The ability of rival firms to engage in coordinated conduct depends on the strength and predictability of rivals’ responses to a price change or other competitive initiative Under some circumstances, a merger can result in market concentration sufficient to strengthen such responses or enable multiple firms in the market to predict them more confidently, thereby affecting the competitive incentives of multiple firms in the market, not just the merged firm 7 1 Impact of Merger on Coordinated Interaction The Agencies examine whether a merger is likely to change the manner in which market participants interact, inducing substantially more coordinated interaction The Agencies seek to identify how a merger might significantly weaken competitive incentives through an increase in the strength, extent, or likelihood of coordinated conduct There are, however, numerous forms of coordination, and the risk that a merger will induce adverse coordinated effects may not be susceptible to quantification or detailed proof Therefore, the Agencies evaluate the risk of coordinated effects using measures of market concentration (see Section 5) in conjunction with an assessment of whether a market is vulnerable to coordinated conduct See Section 7 2 The analysis in Section 7 2 applies to moderately and highly concentrated markets, as unconcentrated markets are unlikely to be vulnerable to coordinated conduct Pursuant to the Clayton Act’s incipiency standard, the Agencies may challenge mergers that in their judgment pose a real danger of harm through coordinated effects, even without specific evidence showing precisely how the coordination likely would take place The Agencies are likely to challenge a merger if the following three conditions are all met (1) the merger would significantly increase concentration and lead to a moderately or highly concentrated market (2) that market shows signs of vulnerability to coordinated conduct (see Section 7 2) and (3) the Agencies have a credible basis on which to conclude that the merger may enhance that vulnerability An acquisition eliminating a maverick firm (see Section 2 1 5) in a market vulnerable to coordinated conduct is likely to cause adverse coordinated effects 7 2 Evidence a Market is Vulnerable to Coordinated Conduct The Agencies presume that market conditions are conducive to coordinated interaction if firms representing a substantial share in the relevant market appear to have previously engaged in express collusion affecting the relevant market, unless competitive conditions in the market have since changed significantly Previous express collusion in another geographic market will have the same weight if the salient characteristics of that other market at the time of the collusion are comparable to those in the relevant market Failed previous attempts at collusion in the relevant market suggest that successful collusion was difficult pre-merger but not so difficult as to deter attempts, and a merger may tend to make success more likely Previous collusion or attempted collusion in another product market may also be given substantial weight if the salient characteristics of that other market at the time of the collusion are closely comparable to those in the relevant market 25    A market typically is more vulnerable to coordinated conduct if each competitively important firm’s significant competitive initiatives can be promptly and confidently observed by that firm’s rivals This is more likely to be the case if the terms offered to customers are relatively transparent Price transparency can be greater for relatively homogeneous products Even if terms of dealing are not transparent, transparency regarding the identities of the firms serving particular customers can give rise to coordination, e g , through customer or territorial allocation Regular monitoring by suppliers of one another’s prices or customers can indicate that the terms offered to customers are relatively transparent A market typically is more vulnerable to coordinated conduct if a firm’s prospective competitive reward from attracting customers away from its rivals will be significantly diminished by likely responses of those rivals This is more likely to be the case, the stronger and faster are the responses the firm anticipates from its rivals The firm is more likely to anticipate strong responses if there are few significant competitors, if products in the relevant market are relatively homogeneous, if customers find it relatively easy to switch between suppliers, or if suppliers use meeting-competition clauses A firm is more likely to be deterred from making competitive initiatives by whatever responses occur if sales are small and frequent rather than via occasional large and long-term contracts or if relatively few customers will switch to it before rivals are able to respond A firm is less likely to be deterred by whatever responses occur if the firm has little stake in the status quo For example, a firm with a small market share that can quickly and dramatically expand, constrained neither by limits on production nor by customer reluctance to switch providers or to entrust business to a historically small provider, is unlikely to be deterred Firms are also less likely to be deterred by whatever responses occur if competition in the relevant market is marked by leapfrogging technological innovation, so that responses by competitors leave the gains from successful innovation largely intact A market is more apt to be vulnerable to coordinated conduct if the firm initiating a price increase will lose relatively few customers after rivals respond to the increase Similarly, a market is more apt to be vulnerable to coordinated conduct if a firm that first offers a lower price or improved product to customers will retain relatively few customers thus attracted away from its rivals after those rivals respond The Agencies regard coordinated interaction as more likely, the more the participants stand to gain from successful coordination Coordination generally is more profitable, the lower is the market elasticity of demand Coordinated conduct can harm customers even if not all firms in the relevant market engage in the coordination, but significant harm normally is likely only if a substantial part of the market is subject to such conduct The prospect of harm depends on the collective market power, in the relevant market, of firms whose incentives to compete are substantially weakened by coordinated conduct This collective market power is greater, the lower is the market elasticity of demand This collective market power is diminished by the presence of other market participants with small market shares and little stake in the outcome resulting from the coordinated conduct, if these firms can rapidly expand their sales in the relevant market 26             Buyer characteristics and the nature of the procurement process can affect coordination For example, sellers may have the incentive to bid aggressively for a large contract even if they expect strong responses by rivals This is especially the case for sellers with small market shares, if they can realistically win such large contracts In some cases, a large buyer may be able to strategically undermine coordinated conduct, at least as it pertains to that buyer’s needs, by choosing to put up for bid a few large contracts rather than many smaller ones, and by making its procurement decisions opaque to suppliers 8 Powerful Buyers Powerful buyers are often able to negotiate favorable terms with their suppliers Such terms may reflect the lower costs of serving these buyers, but they also can reflect price discrimination in their favor The Agencies consider the possibility that powerful buyers may constrain the ability of the merging parties to raise prices This can occur, for example, if powerful buyers have the ability and incentive to vertically integrate upstream or sponsor entry, or if the conduct or presence of large buyers undermines coordinated effects However, the Agencies do not presume that the presence of powerful buyers alone forestalls adverse competitive effects flowing from the merger Even buyers that can negotiate favorable terms may be harmed by an increase in market power The Agencies examine the choices available to powerful buyers and how those choices likely would change due to the merger Normally, a merger that eliminates a supplier whose presence contributed significantly to a buyer’s negotiating leverage will harm that buyer Example 22 Customer C has been able to negotiate lower pre-merger prices than other customers by threatening to shift its large volume of purchases from one merging firm to the other No other suppliers are as well placed to meet Customer C’s needs for volume and reliability The merger is likely to harm Customer C In this situation, the Agencies could identify a price discrimination market consisting of Customer C and similarly placed customers The merger threatens to end previous price discrimination in their favor Furthermore, even if some powerful buyers could protect themselves, the Agencies also consider whether market power can be exercised against other buyers Example 23 In Example 22, if Customer C instead obtained the lower pre-merger prices based on a credible threat to supply its own needs, or to sponsor new entry, Customer C might not be harmed However, even in this case, other customers may still be harmed 9 Entry The analysis of competitive effects in Sections 6 and 7 focuses on current participants in the relevant market That analysis may also include some forms of entry Firms that would rapidly and easily enter the market in response to a SSNIP are market participants and may be assigned market shares See Sections 5 1 and 5 2 Firms that have, prior to the merger, committed to entering the market also will normally be treated as market participants See Section 5 1 This section concerns entry or adjustments to pre-existing entry plans that are induced by the merger 27    As part of their full assessment of competitive effects, the Agencies consider entry into the relevant market The prospect of entry into the relevant market will alleviate concerns about adverse competitive effects only if such entry will deter or counteract any competitive effects of concern so the merger will not substantially harm customers The Agencies consider the actual history of entry into the relevant market and give substantial weight to this evidence Lack of successful and effective entry in the face of non-transitory increases in the margins earned on products in the relevant market tends to suggest that successful entry is slow or difficult Market values of incumbent firms greatly exceeding the replacement costs of their tangible assets may indicate that these firms have valuable intangible assets, which may be difficult or time consuming for an entrant to replicate A merger is not likely to enhance market power if entry into the market is so easy that the merged firm and its remaining rivals in the market, either unilaterally or collectively, could not profitably raise price or otherwise reduce competition compared to the level that would prevail in the absence of the merger Entry is that easy if entry would be timely, likely, and sufficient in its magnitude, character, and scope to deter or counteract the competitive effects of concern The Agencies examine the timeliness, likelihood, and sufficiency of the entry efforts an entrant might practically employ An entry effort is defined by the actions the firm must undertake to produce and sell in the market Various elements of the entry effort will be considered These elements can include planning, design, and management permitting, licensing, or other approvals construction, debugging, and operation of production facilities and promotion (including necessary introductory discounts), marketing, distribution, and satisfaction of customer testing and qualification requirements Recent examples of entry, whether successful or unsuccessful, generally provide the starting point for identifying the elements of practical entry efforts They also can be informative regarding the scale necessary for an entrant to be successful, the presence or absence of entry barriers, the factors that influence the timing of entry, the costs and risk associated with entry, and the sales opportunities realistically available to entrants If the assets necessary for an effective and profitable entry effort are widely available, the Agencies will not necessarily attempt to identify which firms might enter Where an identifiable set of firms appears to have necessary assets that others lack, or to have particularly strong incentives to enter, the Agencies focus their entry analysis on those firms Firms operating in adjacent or complementary markets, or large customers themselves, may be best placed to enter However, the Agencies will not presume that a powerful firm in an adjacent market or a large customer will enter the relevant market unless there is reliable evidence supporting that conclusion In assessing whether entry will be timely, likely, and sufficient, the Agencies recognize that precise and detailed information may be difficult or impossible to obtain The Agencies consider reasonably available and reliable evidence bearing on whether entry will satisfy the conditions of timeliness, likelihood, and sufficiency 28      9 1 Timeliness In order to deter the competitive effects of concern, entry must be rapid enough to make unprofitable overall the actions causing those effects and thus leading to entry, even though those actions would be profitable until entry takes effect Even if the prospect of entry does not deter the competitive effects of concern, post-merger entry may counteract them This requires that the impact of entrants in the relevant market be rapid enough that customers are not significantly harmed by the merger, despite any anticompetitive harm that occurs prior to the entry The Agencies will not presume that an entrant can have a significant impact on prices before that entrant is ready to provide the relevant product to customers unless there is reliable evidence that anticipated future entry would have such an effect on prices 9 2 Likelihood Entry is likely if it would be profitable, accounting for the assets, capabilities, and capital needed and the risks involved, including the need for the entrant to incur costs that would not be recovered if the entrant later exits Profitability depends upon (a) the output level the entrant is likely to obtain, accounting for the obstacles facing new entrants (b) the price the entrant would likely obtain in the post-merger market, accounting for the impact of that entry itself on prices and (c) the cost per unit the entrant would likely incur, which may depend upon the scale at which the entrant would operate 9 3 Sufficiency Even where timely and likely, entry may not be sufficient to deter or counteract the competitive effects of concern For example, in a differentiated product industry, entry may be insufficient because the products offered by entrants are not close enough substitutes to the products offered by the merged firm to render a price increase by the merged firm unprofitable Entry may also be insufficient due to constraints that limit entrants’ competitive effectiveness, such as limitations on the capabilities of the firms best placed to enter or reputational barriers to rapid expansion by new entrants Entry by a single firm that will replicate at least the scale and strength of one of the merging firms is sufficient Entry by one or more firms operating at a smaller scale may be sufficient if such firms are not at a significant competitive disadvantage 10 Efficiencies Competition usually spurs firms to achieve efficiencies internally Nevertheless, a primary benefit of mergers to the economy is their potential to generate significant efficiencies and thus enhance the merged firm’s ability and incentive to compete, which may result in lower prices, improved quality, enhanced service, or new products For example, merger-generated efficiencies may enhance competition by permitting two ineffective competitors to form a more effective competitor, e g , by combining complementary assets In a unilateral effects context, incremental cost reductions may reduce or reverse any increases in the merged firm’s incentive to elevate price Efficiencies also may lead to new or improved products, even if they do not immediately and directly affect price In a 29                           coordinated effects context, incremental cost reductions may make coordination less likely or effective by enhancing the incentive of a maverick to lower price or by creating a new maverick firm Even when efficiencies generated through a merger enhance a firm’s ability to compete, however, a merger may have other effects that may lessen competition and make the merger anticompetitive The Agencies credit only those efficiencies likely to be accomplished with the proposed merger and unlikely to be accomplished in the absence of either the proposed merger or another means having comparable anticompetitive effects These are termed merger-specific efficiencies 13 Only alternatives that are practical in the business situation faced by the merging firms are considered in making this determination The Agencies do not insist upon a less restrictive alternative that is merely theoretical Efficiencies are difficult to verify and quantify, in part because much of the information relating to efficiencies is uniquely in the possession of the merging firms Moreover, efficiencies projected reasonably and in good faith by the merging firms may not be realized Therefore, it is incumbent upon the merging firms to substantiate efficiency claims so that the Agencies can verify by reasonable means the likelihood and magnitude of each asserted efficiency, how and when each would be achieved (and any costs of doing so), how each would enhance the merged firm’s ability and incentive to compete, and why each would be merger-specific Efficiency claims will not be considered if they are vague, speculative, or otherwise cannot be verified by reasonable means Projections of efficiencies may be viewed with skepticism, particularly when generated outside of the usual business planning process By contrast, efficiency claims substantiated by analogous past experience are those most likely to be credited Cognizable efficiencies are merger-specific efficiencies that have been verified and do not arise from anticompetitive reductions in output or service Cognizable efficiencies are assessed net of costs produced by the merger or incurred in achieving those efficiencies The Agencies will not challenge a merger if cognizable efficiencies are of a character and magnitude such that the merger is not likely to be anticompetitive in any relevant market 14 To make the requisite determination, the Agencies consider whether cognizable efficiencies likely would be sufficient to reverse the merger’s potential to harm customers in the relevant market, e g , by preventing price 13 The Agencies will not deem efficiencies to be merger-specific if they could be attained by practical alternatives that mitigate competitive concerns, such as divestiture or licensing If a merger affects not whether but only when an efficiency would be achieved, only the timing advantage is a merger-specific efficiency 14 The Agencies normally assess competition in each relevant market affected by a merger independently and normally will challenge the merger if it is likely to be anticompetitive in any relevant market In some cases, however, the Agencies in their prosecutorial discretion will consider efficiencies not strictly in the relevant market, but so inextricably linked with it that a partial divestiture or other remedy could not feasibly eliminate the anticompetitive effect in the relevant market without sacrificing the efficiencies in the other market(s) Inextricably linked efficiencies are most likely to make a difference when they are great and the likely anticompetitive effect in the relevant market(s) is small so the merger is likely to benefit customers overall 30                       increases in that market 15 In conducting this analysis, the Agencies will not simply compare the magnitude of the cognizable efficiencies with the magnitude of the likely harm to competition absent the efficiencies The greater the potential adverse competitive effect of a merger, the greater must be the cognizable efficiencies, and the more they must be passed through to customers, for the Agencies to conclude that the merger will not have an anticompetitive effect in the relevant market When the potential adverse competitive effect of a merger is likely to be particularly substantial, extraordinarily great cognizable efficiencies would be necessary to prevent the merger from being anticompetitive In adhering to this approach, the Agencies are mindful that the antitrust laws give competition, not internal operational efficiency, primacy in protecting customers In the Agencies’ experience, efficiencies are most likely to make a difference in merger analysis when the likely adverse competitive effects, absent the efficiencies, are not great Efficiencies almost never justify a merger to monopoly or near-monopoly Just as adverse competitive effects can arise along multiple dimensions of conduct, such as pricing and new product development, so too can efficiencies operate along multiple dimensions Similarly, purported efficiency claims based on lower prices can be undermined if they rest on reductions in product quality or variety that customers value The Agencies have found that certain types of efficiencies are more likely to be cognizable and substantial than others For example, efficiencies resulting from shifting production among facilities formerly owned separately, which enable the merging firms to reduce the incremental cost of production, are more likely to be susceptible to verification and are less likely to result from anticompetitive reductions in output Other efficiencies, such as those relating to research and development, are potentially substantial but are generally less susceptible to verification and may be the result of anticompetitive output reductions Yet others, such as those relating to procurement, management, or capital cost, are less likely to be merger-specific or substantial, or may not be cognizable for other reasons When evaluating the effects of a merger on innovation, the Agencies consider the ability of the merged firm to conduct research or development more effectively Such efficiencies may spur innovation but not affect short-term pricing The Agencies also consider the ability of the merged firm to appropriate a greater fraction of the benefits resulting from its innovations Licensing and intellectual property conditions may be important to this enquiry, as they affect the ability of a firm to appropriate the benefits of its innovation Research and development cost savings may be substantial and yet not be cognizable efficiencies because they are difficult to verify or result from anticompetitive reductions in innovative activities 15 The Agencies normally give the most weight to the results of this analysis over the short term The Agencies also may consider the effects of cognizable efficiencies with no short-term, direct effect on prices in the relevant market Delayed benefits from efficiencies (due to delay in the achievement of, or the realization of customer benefits from, the efficiencies) will be given less weight because they are less proximate and more difficult to predict Efficiencies relating to costs that are fixed in the short term are unlikely to benefit customers in the short term, but can benefit customers in the longer run, e g , if they make new product introduction less expensive 31                          11 Failure and Exiting Assets Notwithstanding the analysis above, a merger is not likely to enhance market power if imminent failure, as defined below, of one of the merging firms would cause the assets of that firm to exit the relevant market This is an extreme instance of the more general circumstance in which the competitive significance of one of the merging firms is declining the projected market share and significance of the exiting firm is zero If the relevant assets would otherwise exit the market, customers are not worse off after the merger than they would have been had the merger been enjoined The Agencies do not normally credit claims that the assets of the failing firm would exit the relevant market unless all of the following circumstances are met (1) the allegedly failing firm would be unable to meet its financial obligations in the near future (2) it would not be able to reorganize successfully under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act and (3) it has made unsuccessful good-faith efforts to elicit reasonable alternative offers that would keep its tangible and intangible assets in the relevant market and pose a less severe danger to competition than does the proposed merger 16 Similarly, a merger is unlikely to cause competitive harm if the risks to competition arise from the acquisition of a failing division The Agencies do not normally credit claims that the assets of a division would exit the relevant market in the near future unless both of the following conditions are met (1) applying cost allocation rules that reflect true economic costs, the division has a persistently negative cash flow on an operating basis, and such negative cash flow is not economically justified for the firm by benefits such as added sales in complementary markets or enhanced customer goodwill 17 and (2) the owner of the failing division has made unsuccessful good-faith efforts to elicit reasonable alternative offers that would keep its tangible and intangible assets in the relevant market and pose a less severe danger to competition than does the proposed acquisition 12 Mergers of Competing Buyers Mergers of competing buyers can enhance market power on the buying side of the market, just as mergers of competing sellers can enhance market power on the selling side of the market Buyer market power is sometimes called “monopsony power ” To evaluate whether a merger is likely to enhance market power on the buying side of the market, the Agencies employ essentially the framework described above for evaluating whether a merger is likely to enhance market power on the selling side of the market In defining relevant markets, the Agencies 16 Any offer to purchase the assets of the failing firm for a price above the liquidation value of those assets will be regarded as a reasonable alternative offer Liquidation value is the highest value the assets could command for use outside the relevant market 17 Because the parent firm can allocate costs, revenues, and intra-company transactions among itself and its subsidiaries and divisions, the Agencies require evidence on these two points that is not solely based on management plans that could have been prepared for the purpose of demonstrating negative cash flow or the prospect of exit from the relevant market 32          focus on the alternatives available to sellers in the face of a decrease in the price paid by a hypothetical monopsonist Market power on the buying side of the market is not a significant concern if suppliers have numerous attractive outlets for their goods or services However, when that is not the case, the Agencies may conclude that the merger of competing buyers is likely to lessen competition in a manner harmful to sellers The Agencies distinguish between effects on sellers arising from a lessening of competition and effects arising in other ways A merger that does not enhance market power on the buying side of the market can nevertheless lead to a reduction in prices paid by the merged firm, for example, by reducing transactions costs or allowing the merged firm to take advantage of volume-based discounts Reduction in prices paid by the merging firms not arising from the enhancement of market power can be significant in the evaluation of efficiencies from a merger, as discussed in Section 10 The Agencies do not view a short-run reduction in the quantity purchased as the only, or best, indicator of whether a merger enhances buyer market power Nor do the Agencies evaluate the competitive effects of mergers between competing buyers strictly, or even primarily, on the basis of effects in the downstream markets in which the merging firms sell Example 24 Merging Firms A and B are the only two buyers in the relevant geographic market for an agricultural product Their merger will enhance buyer power and depress the price paid to farmers for this product, causing a transfer of wealth from farmers to the merged firm and inefficiently reducing supply These effects can arise even if the merger will not lead to any increase in the price charged by the merged firm for its output 13 Partial Acquisitions In most horizontal mergers, two competitors come under common ownership and control, completely and permanently eliminating competition between them This elimination of competition is a basic element of merger analysis However, the statutory provisions referenced in Section 1 also apply to one firm’s partial acquisition of a competitor The Agencies therefore also review acquisitions of minority positions involving competing firms, even if such minority positions do not necessarily or completely eliminate competition between the parties to the transaction When the Agencies determine that a partial acquisition results in effective control of the target firm, or involves substantially all of the relevant assets of the target firm, they analyze the transaction much as they do a merger Partial acquisitions that do not result in effective control may nevertheless present significant competitive concerns and may require a somewhat distinct analysis from that applied to full mergers or to acquisitions involving effective control The details of the postacquisition relationship between the parties, and how those details are likely to affect competition, can be important While the Agencies will consider any way in which a partial acquisition may affect competition, they generally focus on three principal effects First, a partial acquisition can lessen competition by giving the acquiring firm the ability to influence the competitive conduct of the target firm A voting interest in the target firm or specific governance rights, such as the right to appoint members to the board of directors, can permit such influence Such 33   influence can lessen competition because the acquiring firm can use its influence to induce the target firm to compete less aggressively or to coordinate its conduct with that of the acquiring firm Second, a partial acquisition can lessen competition by reducing the incentive of the acquiring firm to compete Acquiring a minority position in a rival might significantly blunt the incentive of the acquiring firm to compete aggressively because it shares in the losses thereby inflicted on that rival This reduction in the incentive of the acquiring firm to compete arises even if cannot influence the conduct of the target firm As compared with the unilateral competitive effect of a full merger, this effect is likely attenuated by the fact that the ownership is only partial Third, a partial acquisition can lessen competition by giving the acquiring firm access to non-public, competitively sensitive information from the target firm Even absent any ability to influence the conduct of the target firm, access to competitively sensitive information can lead to adverse unilateral or coordinated effects For example, it can enhance the ability of the two firms to coordinate their behavior, and make other accommodating responses faster and more targeted The risk of coordinated effects is greater if the transaction also facilitates the flow of competitively sensitive information from the acquiring firm to the target firm Partial acquisitions, like mergers, vary greatly in their potential for anticompetitive effects Accordingly, the specific facts of each case must be examined to assess the likelihood of harm to competition While partial acquisitions usually do not enable many of the types of efficiencies associated with mergers, the Agencies consider whether a partial acquisition is likely to create cognizable efficiencies 34"}

FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT Supreme Court of United States 722 Edward H Hatton argued the cause for petitioners With him on the briefs were Lynne E McNown, Alan L Metz, Samuel J Betar, Earl E Pollack, James P Morgan, Thomas W Johnston, and George B Collins 722 Lee A Freeman, Jr , Special Assistant Attorney General of Illinois, argued the cause for respondents With him on the brief was William J Scott, Attorney General Assistant Attorney General Baker argued the cause for the United States as amicus curiae urging affirmance With him on the brief were Acting Solicitor General Friedman and Carl D Lawson [ ] 723 MR JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court 723 Hanover Shoe, Inc v United Shoe Machinery Corp , 392 U S 481 (1968), involved an antitrust trebledamages action 724 brought under § 4 of the Clayton Act[1] against a manufacturer of shoe machinery by one of its customers, a manufacturer of shoes In defense, the shoe machinery manufacturer sought to show that the plaintiff had not been injured in its business as required by § 4 because it had passed on the claimed illegal overcharge to those who bought shoes from it Under the defendant's theory, the illegal overcharge was absorbed by the plaintiff's customers—indirect purchasers of the defendant's shoe machinery—who were the persons actually injured by the antitrust violation 724 In Hanover Shoe this Court rejected as a matter of law this defense that indirect rather than direct purchasers were the parties injured by the antitrust violation The Court held that, except in certain limited circumstances,[2] a direct purchaser suing for treble damages under § 4 of the Clayton Act is injured within the meaning of § 4 by the full amount of the overcharge paid by it and that the antitrust defendant is 725 not permitted to introduce evidence that indirect purchasers were in fact injured by the illegal overcharge 392 U S , at 494 The first reason for the Court's rejection of this offer of proof was an unwillingness to complicate treble-damages actions with attempts to trace the effects of the overcharge on the purchaser's prices, sales, costs, and profits, and of showing that these variables would have behaved differently without the overcharge Id , at 492-493 [3] A second reason for barring the pass-on defense was the Court's concern that unless direct purchasers were allowed to sue for the portion of the overcharge arguably passed on to indirect purchasers, antitrust violators \"would retain the fruits of their illegality\" 726 because indirect purchasers \"would have only a tiny stake in the lawsuit\" and hence little incentive to sue Id , at 494 725 726 5/2/22, 10 11 AM Illinois Brick Co v Illinois, 431 US 720 - Supreme Court 1977 - Google Scholar https //scholar google

deemed for purposes of § 4 to have suffered the full injury from the overcharge but the issue is presented in the context of a suit in which the plaintiff, an indirect purchaser, seeks to show its injury by establishing pass-on by the direct purchaser and in which the antitrust defendants rely on Hanover Shoe's rejection of the pass-on theory Having decided that in general a pass-on theory may not be used defensively by an antitrust violator against a direct purchaser plaintiff, we must now decide whether that theory may be used offensively by an indirect purchaser plaintiff against an alleged violator I Petitioners manufacture and distribute concrete block in the Greater Chicago area They sell the block primarily to masonry contractors, who submit bids to general contractors for the masonry portions of construction projects The general contractors in turn submit bids for these projects to customers such as the respondents in this case, the State of Illinois and 700 local governmental entities in the Greater Chicago area, including counties, municipalities, housing authorities, and school districts See 67 F R D 461, 463 (ND Ill 1975) App 16-48 Respondents are thus indirect purchasers of concrete block, which passes through two separate levels in the chain of distribution before reaching respondents The block is purchased directly from petitioners by masonry contractors and used by them to build masonry structures those structures are incorporated into entire buildings by general contractors and sold to respondents Respondent State of Illinois, on behalf of itself and respondent local governmental entities, brought this antitrust treble-damages action under § 4 of the Clayton Act, alleging that 727 petitioners had engaged in a combination and conspiracy to fix the prices of concrete block in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act [4] The complaint alleged that the amounts paid by respondents for concrete block were more than $3 million higher by reason of this price-fixing conspiracy The only way in which the antitrust violation alleged could have injured respondents is if all or part of the overcharge was passed on by the masonry and general contractors to respondents, rather than being absorbed at the first two levels of distribution See Illinois v Ampress Brick Co , 536 F 2d 1163, 1164 (CA7 1976) [5] 727 Petitioner manufacturers moved for partial summary judgment against all plaintiffs that were indirect purchasers of concrete block from petitioners, contending that as a matter of law only direct purchasers could sue for the alleged overcharge [6] The District Court granted petitioners' motion, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that indirect purchasers such as respondents in this case can recover treble damages for an illegal overcharge if they can prove that the overcharge 728 was passed on to them through intervening links in the distribution chain [7] 728 We granted certiorari, 429 U S 938 (1976), to resolve a conflict among the Courts of Appeals[8] on the question whether the offensive use of pass-on authorized by the decision below is consistent with Hanover Shoe's restrictions on the defensive use of pass-on We hold that it is not, and we reverse We reach this result in two steps First, we conclude that whatever rule is to be adopted regarding pass-on in antitrust damages actions, it must apply equally to plaintiffs and defendants Because Hanover Shoe would bar petitioners from using respondents' pass-on theory as a defense to a treble-damages suit 729 by the direct purchasers (the masonry contractors),[9] we are faced with the choice of overruling (or narrowly limiting) Hanover Shoe or of applying it to bar respondents' attempt to use this pass-on theory offensively Second, we decline to abandon the construction given § 4 in Hanover Shoe—that the overcharged direct purchaser, and not others in the chain of manufacture or distribution, is the party \"injured in his business or property\" 729 5/2/22, 10 11 AM Illinois Brick Co v Illinois, 431 US 720 - Supreme Court 1977 - Google Scholar https //scholar google com/scholar case?case=11635537603314405616 q=Illinois+Brick+Co +v +Illinois hl=en as sdt=2006 3/22 within the meaning of the section—in the absence of a convincing demonstration that the Court was wrong in Hanover Shoe to think that the effectiveness of the antitrust treble-damages action would be substantially reduced by adopting a rule that any party in the chain may sue to recover the fraction of the overcharge allegedly absorbed by it II The parties in this case agree that however § 4 is construed with respect to the pass-on issue, the rule should apply equally to plaintiffs and defendants—that an indirect purchaser should not be allowed to use a pass-on theory to recover damages from a defendant unless the defendant would be allowed to use a pass-on defense in a suit by a direct purchaser Respondents, in arguing that they should be allowed to recover by showing pass-on in this case, have conceded that petitioners should be allowed to assert a pass-on defense against direct purchasers of concrete block, Tr of Oral Arg 33, 48 they ask this Court to limit Hanover Shoe's bar on pass-on defenses to its \"particular factual context\" of overcharges for capital goods used to manufacture new products Id , at 41 see id , at 36, 47-48 Before turning to this request to limit Hanover Shoe, we consider the substantially contrary position, adopted by our dissenting Brethren, by the United States as amicus curiae, and by lower courts that have allowed offensive use of pass-on, that the unavailability of a pass-on theory to a defendant 730 should not necessarily preclude its use by plaintiffs seeking treble damages against that defendant [10] Under this view, Hanover Shoe's rejection of pass-on would continue to apply to defendants unless direct and indirect purchasers were both suing the defendant in the same action but it would not bar indirect purchasers from attempting to show that the overcharge had been passed on to them We reject this position for two reasons 730 First, allowing offensive but not defensive use of pass-on would create a serious risk of multiple liability for defendants Even though an indirect purchaser had already recovered for all or part of an overcharge passed on to it, the direct purchaser would still recover automatically the full amount of the overcharge that the indirect purchaser had shown to be passed on similarly, following an automatic recovery of the full overcharge by the direct purchaser, the indirect purchaser could sue to recover the same amount The risk of duplicative recoveries created by unequal application of the Hanover Shoe rule is much more substantial than in the more usual situation where the defendant is sued in two different lawsuits by plaintiffs asserting conflicting claims to the same fund A one-sided application of Hanover Shoe substantially increases the possibility of inconsistent adjudications—and therefore of unwarranted multiple liability for the defendant — by presuming that one plaintiff (the direct purchaser) is entitled to full recovery while preventing the defendant from using that presumption against the other plaintiff overlapping recoveries are certain to result from the two lawsuits 731 unless the indirect purchaser is unable to establish any pass-on whatsoever As in Hawaii v Standard Oil Co of Cal , 405 U S 251, 264 (1972), we are unwilling to \"open the door to duplicative recoveries\" under § 4 [11] 731 Second, the reasoning of Hanover Shoe cannot justify unequal treatment of plaintiffs and defendants with respect to the permissibility of pass-on arguments The principal basis for the decision in Hanover Shoe was the Court's perception of the uncertainties and difficulties in analyzing price and output 732 put decisions \"in the real economic world rather than an economist's hypothetical model,\" 392 U S , at 493, and of the costs to the judicial system and the efficient enforcement of the antitrust laws of attempting to reconstruct those decisions in the courtroom [12] This perception that the attempt to trace the complex 732 5/2/22, 10 11 AM Illinois Brick Co v Illinois, 431 US 720 - Supreme Court 1977 - Google Scholar https //scholar google com/scholar case?case=11635537603314405616

already protracted treble-damages proceedings applies with no less force to the assertion of pass-on theories by plaintiffs than it does to the assertion by defendants However \"long and complicated\" the proceeding would be when defendants sought to prove pass-on, ibid , they would be equally so when the same evidence was introduced by plaintiffs Indeed, the evidentiary complexities and uncertainties involved in the defensive use of pass-on against a direct purchaser are multiplied in the offensive use of pass-on by a plaintiff several steps removed from the defendant in the chain of distribution The demonstration of how much of the overcharge was passed on by the first purchaser must be repeated at each point at which 733 the price-fixed goods changed hands before they reached the plaintiff [13] 733 It is argued, however, that Hanover Shoe rests on a policy of ensuring that a treble-damages plaintiff is available to deprive antitrust violators of \"the fruits of their illegality,\" id , at 494, a policy that would be furthered by allowing plaintiffs but not defendants to use pass-on theories See, e g , In re Western Liquid Asphalt Cases, 487 F 2d 191, 197 (CA9

for the effectiveness of the treble-damages remedy as countenancing unequal application of the Court's pass-on rule Rather, we understand Hanover Shoe 735 as resting on the judgment that the antitrust laws will be more effectively enforced by concentrating the full recovery for the overcharge in the direct purchasers rather than by allowing every plaintiff potentially affected by the overcharge to sue only for the amount it could show was absorbed by it 734 735 We thus decline to construe § 4 to permit offensive use of a pass-on theory against an alleged violator that could not use the same theory as a defense in an action by direct purchasers In this case, respondents seek to demonstrate that masonry contractors, who incorporated petitioners' block into walls and other masonry structures, passed on the alleged overcharge on the block to general contractors, who incorporated the masonry structures into entire buildings, and that the general contractors in turn passed on the overcharge to respondents in the bids submitted for those buildings We think it clear that under a fair reading of Hanover Shoe petitioners would be barred from asserting this theory in a suit by the masonry contractors In Hanover Shoe this Court did not endorse the broad exception that had been recognized in that case by the courts below—permitting the pass-on defense against middlemen who did not alter the goods they purchased before reselling them [15] The masonry contractors here could not be included under this exception in any event, because they transform the concrete block purchased from defendants into the masonry portions of buildings But this Court in Hanover Shoe 736 indicated the narrow scope it intended for any exception to its rule barring pass-on defenses by citing, as the only example of a situation where the defense might be permitted, a preexisting cost-plus contract In such a situation, the purchaser is insulated from any decrease in its sales as a result of attempting to pass on the overcharge, because its customer is committed to buying a fixed quantity regardless of price The effect of the overcharge is essentially determined in advance, without reference to the interaction of supply and demand that complicates the determination in the general case The competitive bidding process by which the concrete block involved in this case was incorporated into masonry structures and then into entire buildings can hardly be said to circumvent complex market interactions as would a cost-plus contract [16] 736 We are left, then, with two alternatives either we must overrule Hanover Shoe (or at least narrowly confine it to its facts), or we must preclude respondents from seeking to recover on their pass-on theory We choose the latter course 5/2/22, 10 11 AM Illinois Brick Co v Illinois, 431 US 720 - Supreme Court 1977 - Google Scholar https //scholar google com/scholar case?case=11635537603314405616 q=Illinois+Brick+Co +v +Illinois hl=en as sdt=2006 5/22 III In considering whether to cut back or abandon the Hanover Shoe rule, we must bear in mind that considerations of stare decisis weigh heavily in the area of statutory construction, where Congress is free to change this Court's interpretation of its legislation See Edelman v Jordan, 415 U S 651, 671 (1974) Burnet v Coronado Oil Gas Co , 285 U S 393, 406-408 (1932) (Brandeis, J , dissenting) This presumption of adherence to our prior decisions construing legislative enactments would support our reaffirmance of the Hanover Shoe 737 construction of § 4, joined by eight Justices without dissent only a few years ago,[17] even if the Court were persuaded that the use of pass-on theories by plaintiffs and defendants in treble-damages actions is more consistent with the policies underlying the treble-damages action than is the Hanover Shoe rule But we are not so persuaded 737 Permitting the use of pass-on theories under § 4 essentially would transform treble-damages actions into massive efforts to apportion the recovery among all potential plaintiffs that could have absorbed part of the overcharge—from direct purchasers to middlemen to ultimate consumers However appealing this attempt to allocate the overcharge might seem in theory, it would add whole new dimensions of complexity to trebledamages suits and seriously undermine their effectiveness As we have indicated, potential plaintiffs at each level in the distribution chain are in a position to assert conflicting claims to a common fund—the amount of the alleged overcharge —by contending that the entire overcharge was absorbed at that particular level in the chain [18] A treble-damages action brought by one of these potential plaintiffs (or one class of potential plaintiffs) to recover the overcharge implicates all three of the interests that have traditionally been thought to support compulsory joinder of absent and potentially adverse claimants the interest of the defendant in 738 avoiding multiple liability for the fund the interest of the absent potential plaintiffs in protecting their right to recover for the portion of the fund allocable to them and the social interest in the efficient administration of justice and the avoidance of multiple litigation Reed, Compulsory Joinder of Parties in Civil Actions, 55 Mich L Rev 327, 330 (1957) See Provident Tradesmens Bank Trust Co v Patterson, 390 U S 102, 110-111 (1968) 7 C Wright A Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1602 (1972) 738 Opponents of the Hanover Shoe rule have recognized this need for compulsory joinder in suggesting that the defendant could interplead potential claimants under 28 U S C § 1335 [19] But if the defendant, for any of a variety of reasons,[20] does not choose to interplead the absent potential claimants, there would be a strong argument for joining them as \"persons needed for just adjudication\" under Fed Rule Civ Proc 19 (a) [21] See Comment, Standing to Sue in Antitrust Cases 739 The Offensive Use of Passing-On, 123 U Pa L Rev 976, 998 (1975) These absent potential claimants would seem to fit the classic definition of \"necessary parties,\" for purposes of compulsory joinder, given in Shields v Barrow, 17 How 130, 139 (1855) 739 \"Persons having an interest in the controversy, and who ought to be made parties, in order that the court may act on that rule which requires it to decide on, and finally determine the entire controversy, and do complete justice, by adjusting all the rights involved in it \" See Notes of Advisory Committee on 1966 Amendment to Rule 19, 28 U S C App , p 7760 7 C Wright A Miller, supra, §§ 1604, 1618 3A J Moore, Federal Practice ¶ 19 08 (1974) The plaintiff bringing the treble-damages

sdt=2006 6/22 pending [22] Where, as would often be the case, the potential claimants at a particular level of distribution are so numerous that joinder of all is impracticable, a representative presumably would have to be found to bring them into the action as a class See Fed Rule Civ Proc 19 (d) 3A J Moore, supra, ¶ 19 21 It is unlikely, of course, that all potential plaintiffs could or would be joined Some may not wish to assert claims to the 740 overcharge others may be unmanageable as a class and still others may be beyond the personal jurisdiction of the court We can assume that ordinarily the action would still proceed, the absent parties not being deemed \"indispensable\" under Fed Rule Civ Proc 19 (b) See Provident Tradesmens Bank Trust Co v Patterson, supra But allowing indirect purchasers to recover using pass-on theories, even under the optimistic assumption that joinder of potential plaintiffs will deal satisfactorily with problems of multiple litigation and liability, would transform treble-damages actions into massive multiparty litigations involving many levels of distribution and including large classes of ultimate consumers remote from the defendant In treble-damages actions by ultimate consumers, the overcharge would have to be apportioned among the relevant wholesalers, retailers, and other middlemen, whose representatives presumably should be joined [23] And in suits 741 by direct purchasers or middlemen, the interests of ultimate consumers are similarly implicated [24] 740 741 There is thus a strong possibility that indirect purchasers remote from the defendant would be parties to virtually every treble-damages action (apart from those brought against defendants at the retail level) The Court's concern in Hanover Shoe to avoid weighing down treble-damages actions with the \"massive evidence and complicated theories,\" 392 U S , at 493, involved in attempting to establish a pass-on defense against a direct purchaser applies a fortiori to the attempt to trace the effect of the overcharge through each step in the distribution chain from the direct purchaser to the ultimate consumer We are no more inclined than we were in Hanover Shoe to ignore the burdens that such an attempt would impose on the effective enforcement of the antitrust laws Under an array of simplifying assumptions, economic theory provides a precise formula for calculating how the overcharge is distributed between the overcharged party (passer) and its customers (passees) If the market for the passer's product is perfectly competitive if the overcharge is imposed equally on all of the passer's competitors and if the passer maximizes its profits, then the ratio of the shares of the overcharge borne by passee and passer will equal the ratio of the elasticities of supply and demand in the market for the passer's product [25] 742 Even if these assumptions are accepted, there remains a serious problem of measuring the relevant elasticities—the percentage change in the quantities of the passer's product demanded and supplied in response to a one percent change in price In view of the difficulties that have been encountered, even in informal adversary proceedings, with the statistical techniques used to estimate these concepts, see Finkelstein, Regression Models in Administrative Proceedings, 86 Harv L Rev 1442, 1444 (1973), it is unrealistic to think that elasticity studies introduced by expert witnesses will resolve the pass-on issue We need look no further than our own difficulties with sophisticated statistical methodology that were evident last Term in Gregg v Georgia, 428 U S 153 (1976), and its companion cases See id , at 184-185 (joint opinion of STEWART, POWELL, and STEVENS, JJ ) 233-236

world rather than an economist's hypothetical model,\" the latter's drastic simplifications generally must be abandoned Overcharged direct purchasers often sell in imperfectly competitive markets They often compete with other 5/2/22, 10 11 AM Illinois Brick Co v Illinois, 431 US 720 - Supreme Court 1977 - Google Scholar https //scholar google com/scholar case?case=11635537603314405616

profit maximization [26] As we concluded in Hanover Shoe, 392 U S , at 492, 743 attention to \"sound laws of economics\" can only heighten the awareness of the difficulties and uncertainties involved in determining how the relevant market variables would have behaved had there been no overcharge [27] 743 It is quite true that these difficulties and uncertainties will be less substantial in some contexts than in others There have been many proposals to allow pass-on theories in some of these contexts while preserving the Hanover Shoe rule in others Respondents here argue, not without support from some lower courts,[28] that pass-on theories should be permitted for middlemen that resell goods without altering them and for contractors that add a fixed percentage markup to the cost of their materials in submitting bids Brief for Respondents 9-30 Tr of Oral Arg 36-48 Exceptions to the Hanover Shoe rule have also been urged for other situations in which most of the overcharge is purportedly passed on—for example, where a pricefixed good is a small but vital input into a 744 much larger product, making the demand for the price-fixed good highly inelastic Compare Philadelphia Housing Auth v American Radiator Standard Sanitary Corp , 50 F R D 13 (ED Pa 1970), aff'd sub nom Mangano v American Radiator Standard Sanitary Corp , 438 F 2d 1187 (CA3 1971), with In re Master Key Antitrust Litigation, 1973-2 Trade Cas ¶ 74,680 (Conn ) See Schaefer, supra n 25, at 918-925 744 We reject these attempts to carve out exceptions to the Hanover Shoe rule for particular types of markets [29] An exception allowing evidence of pass-on by middlemen that resell the goods they purchase of course would be of no avail to respondents, because the contractors that allegedly passed on the overcharge on the block incorporated it into buildings See supra, at 735 An exception for the contractors here on the ground that they purport to charge a fixed percentage above their costs would substantially erode the Hanover Shoe rule without justification Firms in many sectors of the economy rely to an extent on costbased rules of thumb in setting prices See F Scherer, Industrial Market Structure and Economic Performance 173-179 (1970) These rules are not adhered to rigidly, however the extent of the markup (or the allocation of costs) is varied to reflect demand conditions Id , at 176-177 The intricacies of tracing the effect of an overcharge on the purchaser's prices, costs, sales, and profits thus are not spared the litigants More generally, the process of classifying various market situations according to the amount of pass-on likely to be 745 involved and its susceptibility of proof in a judicial forum would entail the very problems that the Hanover Shoe rule was meant to avoid The litigation over where the line should be drawn in a particular class of cases would inject the same \"massive evidence and complicated theories\" into trebledamages proceedings, albeit at a somewhat higher level of generality As we have noted, supra, at 735736, Hanover Shoe itself implicitly discouraged the creation of exceptions to its rule barring pass-on defenses, and we adhere to the narrow scope of exemption indicated by our decision there 745 The concern in Hanover Shoe for the complexity that would be introduced into treble-damages suits if passon theories were permitted was closely related to the Court's concern for the reduction in the effectiveness of those suits if brought by indirect purchasers with a smaller stake in the outcome than that of direct purchasers suing for the full amount of the overcharge The apportionment of the recovery throughout the distribution chain would increase the overall costs of recovery by injecting extremely complex issues into the case at the same time such an apportionment would reduce the benefits to each plaintiff by dividing the potential recovery among a much larger group Added to the uncertainty of how much of an overcharge could be established at trial would be the uncertainty of how that overcharge would be apportioned among the various plaintiffs This additional uncertainty would further reduce the incentive to sue The combination 5/2/22, 10 11 AM Illinois Brick Co v Illinois, 431 US 720 - Supreme Court 1977 - Google Scholar https //scholar google com/scholar case?case=11635537603314405616 q=Illinois+Brick+Co +v +Illinois hl=en as sdt=2006 8/22 of increasing the costs and diffusing the benefits of bringing a treble-damages action could seriously impair this important weapon of antitrust enforcement We think the longstanding policy of encouraging vigorous private enforcement of the antitrust laws, see, e g , Perma Life Mufflers, Inc v International Parts Corp , 392 U S 134, 139 (1968), supports our adherence to the Hanover Shoe rule, under which direct purchasers are not only spared the burden 746 of litigating the intricacies of pass-on but also are permitted to recover the full amount of the overcharge We recognize that direct purchasers sometimes may refrain from bringing a treble-damages suit for fear of disrupting relations with their suppliers [30] But on balance, and until there are clear directions from Congress to the contrary, we conclude that the legislative purpose in creating a group of \" private attorneys general' \" to enforce the antitrust laws under § 4, Hawaii v Standard Oil Co of Cal , 405 U S at 262, is better served by holding direct purchasers to be injured to the full extent of the overcharge paid by them than by attempting to apportion the overcharge among all that may have absorbed a part of it 746 It is true that, in elevating direct purchasers to a preferred position as private attorneys general, the Hanover Shoe rule denies recovery to those indirect purchasers who may have been actually injured by antitrust violations Of course, as MR JUSTICE BRENNAN points out in dissent, \"from the deterrence standpoint, it is irrelevant to whom damages are paid, so long as some one redresses the violation \" Post, at 760 But § 4 has another purpose in addition to deterring violators and depriving them of \"the fruits of their illegality,\" Hanover Shoe, 392 U S at 494 it is also designed to compensate victims of antitrust violations for their injuries E g , Brunswick Corp v Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc , 429 U S 477, 485-486 (1977) Hanover Shoe does further the goal of compensation to the extent that the direct purchaser absorbs at least some and often most of the overcharge In view of the considerations supporting the Hanover Shoe rule, we are unwilling to carry the compensation principle to its logical extreme by attempting to allocate damages among all \"those within the defendant's chain of distribution,\" post, at 761, especially 747 because we question the extent to which such an attempt would make individual victims whole for actual injuries suffered rather than simply depleting the overall recovery in litigation over pass-on issues Many of the indirect purchasers barred from asserting pass-on claims under the Hanover Shoe rule have such a small stake in the lawsuit that even if they were to recover as part of a class, only a small fraction would be likely to come forward to collect their damages [31] And given the difficulty of ascertaining the amount absorbed by any particular indirect purchaser, there is little basis for believing that the amount of the recovery would reflect the actual injury suffered 747 748 For the reasons stated, the judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion 748 So ordered MR JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR JUSTICE MARSHALL and MR JUSTICE BLACKMUN join, dissenting Respondent State of Illinois

been consistent with its broad objectives to compensate victims of antitrust violations and to deter future violations The Court has stated that § 4 \"does not confine its protection to consumers, or to purchasers, or to competitors, or to sellers  [but] is comprehensive in its terms and coverage, protecting all who are made victims of the forbidden practices by whomever they may be perpetrated \" Mandeville Island Farms, Inc v American Crystal Sugar Co , 334 U S 219, 236 (1948) [2] 749 Today's decision that § 4 affords a remedy only to persons who purchase directly from an antitrust offender is a regrettable retreat from that line of cases Section 4 was clearly intended to operate to protect individual consumers who purchase through middlemen Indeed, Congress acted on the premise that § 4 gave a cause of action to indirect as well as direct purchasers when it recently enacted the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, 90 Stat 1394-1396, 15 U S C § 15c et seq (1976 ed ), and authorized state attorneys general to sue as parens patriae to recover damages on behalf of citizens of their various States 749 Today's decision flouts Congress' purpose and severely undermines the effectiveness of the private trebledamages action as an instrument of antitrust enforcement For in many instances, the brunt of antitrust injuries is borne by indirect purchasers, often ultimate consumers of a product, as increased costs are passed along the chain of distribution [3] In these instances, the Court's decision frustrates both the compensation and deterrence objectives of the treble-damages action Injured consumers are precluded from recovering damages from manufacturers, and direct purchasers who act as middlemen have little incentive to sue suppliers so long as they may pass on the bulk of the illegal overcharges to the ultimate consumers This frustration of the congressional scheme is in no way mandated by Hanover Shoe, Inc v United Shoe Machinery Corp , 392 U S 481 (1968) To the contrary, the same considerations that Hanover Shoe held 750 required rejection of the defendant's argument there, that because plaintiff had passed on cost increases to consumers in the form of higher prices defendant should be relieved of liability— especially the consideration that it is essential to the public interest to preserve the effectiveness of the private treble-damages action—require affirmance of the decision below construing § 4 to authorize respondent's suit 750 I In Hanover Shoe, supra, the Court held that a defendant in a treble-damages action could not escape liability, except in very limited circumstances,[4] by proof that the plaintiff had passed on illegal overcharges to others farther along in the chain of distribution [5] The defendant in Hanover Shoe, United Shoe, argued that Hanover was not entitled to recover damages because the increased price it had paid for United's equipment[6] had in turn been reflected in the increased price at which Hanover had sold its shoes to the consuming public The Court held that several reasons supported its conclusion that this defense was not available to United despite \"the argument that sound laws of economics require\" its recognition, 392 U S , at 492 First, the Court followed earlier cases holding that the \"victim of an overcharge is [immediately] 751 damaged within the meaning of § 4 to the extent of that overcharge \" Id , at 491 The particularly apt precedent supporting this proposition was Southern Pacific Co v Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co , 245 U S 531 (1918),[7] where a pass-on defense had been rejected because of \"[t]he general tendency of the law, in regard to damages at least,  not to go beyond the first step,\" and the Court's belief that \"[t]he carrier 751 5/2/22, 10 11 AM

10/22 ought not to be allowed to retain his illegal profit, and the only one who can take it from him is the one that alone was in relation with him, and from whom the carrier took the sum  \" Id , at 533-534 In other words, the requirement of privity between plaintiff and defendant was a reason to deny defendant the pass-on defense, since otherwise the defendant would be able to profit by his own wrong Hanover Shoe cannot be read, however, as limiting actions to parties in privity with one another That was made clear in Perkins v Standard Oil Co , 395 U S 642, 648 (1969), decided the next Term, a price discrimination case in which the Court traced an illegal overcharge through several levels in the chain of distribution, ultimately holding that a plaintiff seeking to recover damages need show only a \"causal connection between the price discrimination in violation of the [antitrust laws] and the injury suffered  If there is sufficient evidence in the record to support an inference of causation, the ultimate conclusion as to what that evidence proves is for the jury \" Darnell-Taenzer does, however, support Hanover Shoe's denial of the pass-on defense for the other reasons relied upon in Hanover Shoe the difficulty of proving and quantifying a pass-on, and the role of the treble-damages action as the most effective means of antitrust enforcement 392 U S , at 492-494 The Court correctly discerned that the difficulty of reconstructing 752 hypothetical pricing decisions,[8] would aggravate the already complex nature of antitrust litigation since pass-on defenses would become commonplace whenever the chain of distribution extended beyond the plaintiff This would lessen the effectiveness of the treble-damages action, since ultimate consumers individually often suffer only minor damages and therefore have little incentive to bring suit Limiting defendants' liability to the loss of profits suffered by direct purchasers would thus allow the antitrust offender to avoid having to pay the full social cost of his illegal conduct in many cases in which indirect purchasers failed to bring suit Consequently, 752 \"those who violate the antitrust laws by price fixing or monopolizing would retain the fruits of their illegality because no one was available who would bring suit against them Treble damage actions, the importance of which the Court has many times emphasized, would be substantially reduced in effectiveness \" Id , at 494 Hanover Shoe thus confronted the Court with the choice, as had been true in Darnell-Taenzer, of interpreting § 4 in a way that might overcompensate the plaintiff, who had certainly suffered some injury, or of defining it in a way that underdeters the violator by allowing him to retain a portion of his ill-gotten overcharges The Court chose to interpret § 4 so as to allow the plaintiff to recover for the entire overcharge This choice was consistent with recognition of the importance 753 of the treble-damages action in deterring antitrust violations [9] But Hanover Shoe certainly did not imply that an indirect purchaser would not also have a cause of action under § 4 when the illegal overcharges were passed on to him 753 Despite the superficial appeal of the argument that Hanover Shoe should be applied \"consistently,\" thus precluding plaintiffs and defendants alike from proving that increased costs were passed along the chain of distribution, there are sound reasons for treating offensive and defensive passing-on cases differently The interests at stake in \"offensive\" passing-on cases, where the indirect purchasers sue for damages for their injuries, are simply not the same as the interests at stake in the Hanover Shoe, or \"defensive\" passing-on situation There is no danger in this case, for example, as there was in Hanover Shoe, that the defendant will escape liability and frustrate the objectives of the treble-damages action Rather, the same policies of insuring the continued effectiveness of the treble-damages action and preventing wrongdoers from retaining the spoils of their misdeeds favor allowing indirect purchasers to prove that overcharges were passed on to them Hanover Shoe thus can and should be limited to cases of defensive assertion of the passing-on defense to antitrust liability, where direct and indirect purchasers are not parties in the same action [10] I fully agree with the observation 5/2/22, 10 11 AM Illinois Brick Co v Illinois, 431 US 720 - Supreme Court 1977 - Google Scholar https //scholar google com/scholar

consumers to recover damages for conduct which is prohibited by the Sherman Act, by giving State attorneys general a cause of action [to sue as parens patriae on behalf of the States' citizens] against antitrust violators \" S Rep No 94-803, p 6 (1976) Title III of the new Act responded to the holding of Hawaii v Standard Oil Co of Cal , 405 U S 251 (1972), that the Clayton Act does not authorize a State to sue for damages for an injury to its general economy allegedly attributable to a violation of the antitrust laws The Senate Report accompanying the new Act expressly found that \"[t]he economic burden of most antitrust violations is borne by the consumer in the form of higher prices for goods and services,\" S Rep No 94-803, supra, at 39, and it is clear that the new Act is intended to provide a remedy 757 for injured consumers whether or not they purchased directly from the violator The Senate Report states, id , at 42 757 \"A direct cause of action is granted the States to avoid the inequities and inconsistencies of restrictive judicial interpretations  Section 4C is intended to assure that consumers are not precluded from the opportunity of proving the amount of their damage and to avoid problems with respect to manageability [of class actions], standing, privity, target area, remoteness, and the like \"[13] (Emphasis supplied ) Representative Rodino, a sponsor, stated during the House debates \"[A]ssuming the State attorney general proves a violation, and proves that an overcharge was passed on' to the consumers, injuring them in their property' that is, their pocketbooks— recoveries are authorized by the compromise bill whether or not the consumers purchased directly from the price fixer, or indirectly, from intermediaries, retailers, or middlemen The technical and procedural argument that consumers have no standing' whenever they are not in privity' with the price fixer, and have not purchased directly from him, is rejected by the compromise bill Opinions relying on this procedural 758 technicality  are squarely rejected by the compromise bill \" 122 Cong Rec H10295 (daily ed Sept 16, 1976) 758 It is difficult to see how Congress could have expressed itself more clearly Even if the question whether indirect purchasers could recover for damages passed on to them was open before passage of the 1976 Act, and I do not believe that it was, Congress' interpretation of § 4 in enacting the parens patriae provision should resolve it in favor of their authority to sue Indeed, the House Report accompanying the bill actually referred to the opinion of the District Court in this case as an example of the correct answer N 13, supra The Court's tortuous efforts to impose a \"consistency\" upon this area of the law that Congress has so clearly rejected is a return to the \"legal somersaults and twisting and turnings\" of the Court's earlier opinions that ultimately led to the passage of the Clayton Act in 1914 to salvage the ailing Sherman Act , See 51 Cong Rec 9086 (1914) (remarks of Rep Kelly) III Hanover Shoe correctly observed that the necessity of tracing a cost increase through several levels of a chain of distribution \"would often require additional long and complicated proceedings involving massive evidence and complicated theories \" 392 U S , at 493 But this may be said of almost all antitrust cases Hanover Shoe itself highlights this unavoidable complication, in that it requires the plaintiff to prove a probable course of events which would have occurred but for the violation [14] In essence, estimating the amount of 759 damages passed on to an indirect purchaser is no different from and no more complicated 759 5/2/22, 10 11 AM Illinois Brick Co v Illinois, 431 US 720 -

selling price would have been, absent the violation See ante, at 733 n 13 Nor should the fact that the price-fixed product in this case (the concrete block) was combined with another product (the buildings) before resale operate as an absolute bar to recovery It may well be true, as the State claims, that the cost of the block was included separately in the project bids and therefore can be factored out from the price of the building with relative certainty In any case, this is a factual matter to be determined based on the strength of the plaintiff's evidence [15] See, e g , In re Western Liquid Asphalt Cases, 487 F 2d 191 (CA9 1973), cert denied sub nom Standard Oil Co of Cal v Alaska, 415 U S 919 (1974) Admittedly, there will be many cases in which the plaintiff will be unable to prove that the overcharge was passed on In others, the portion of the overcharge passed on may be only approximately determinable But again, this problem hardly distinguishes this case from other antitrust cases Reasoned estimation is required in all antitrust cases, but \"while the damages [in such cases] may not be determined by mere speculation or guess, it will be enough if the evidence show the extent of the damages as a matter of just and reasonable inference, although the result be only approximate \" Story Parchment Co v Paterson Co , 282 U S 555, 563 (1931) See also Bigelow v RKO Radio Pictures, 327 U S , at 266 Eastman Kodak Co v Southern Photo Materials Co , 273 U S 359, 379 (1927) Lack of precision in apportioning damages between direct and indirect purchasers is thus plainly not a convincing reason for denying 760 indirect purchasers an opportunity to prove their injuries and damages Moreover, from the deterrence standpoint, it is irrelevant to whom damages are paid, so long as someone redresses the violation Antitrust violators are equally deterred whether the judgments against them are in favor of direct or indirect purchasers Hanover Shoe said as much The Court's decision recognized that some plaintiffs would recover more than their due, but concluded that the necessity of assuring that someone recover and thus deter future violations and prevent the antitrust offender from profiting by his illegal overcharge outweighed any resulting injustice [16] 760 I concede that despite the broad wording of § 4 there is a point beyond which the wrongdoer should not be held liable See, e g , Brunswick Corp v Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc , 429 U S 477 (1977) Hawaii v Standard Oil Co of Cal , 405 U S 251 (1972) Courts have therefore developed various tests of antitrust \"standing,\" not unlike the concept of proximate cause in tort law, to define that point The definition has been variously articulated, usually in terms of two tests The more restrictive test focuses on the directness of the injury [17] the more liberal, and more widely accepted, on whether the plaintiff is within the \"target area\" of the defendant's violation [18] 761 But if the broad language of § 4 means anything, surely it must render the defendant liable to those within the defendant's chain of distribution It would indeed be \"paradoxical to deny recover to the ultimate consumer while permitting the middlemen a windfall recovery \" P Areeda, Antitrust Analysis Problems, Text, Cases 75 (2d ed 1974) 761 IV I acknowledge some abstract merit in the argument that to allow indirect purchasers to sue, while, at the same time, precluding defendants from asserting pass-on defenses in suits by direct purchasers, subjects antitrust defendants to the risk of multiple liability But as a practical matter, existing procedural mechanisms can eliminate this danger in most instances Even though, as the Court says, no procedure currently exists which can eliminate the possibility entirely, ante, at 731 n 11, the hypothetical possibility that a few defendants might be subjected to the danger of multiple liability does not, in my view, justify erecting a bar against all recoveries by indirect purchasers without regard to whether the particular case presents a 5/2/22, 10 11 AM Illinois Brick Co v Illinois, 431 US 720 - Supreme Court 1977 - Google

was argued in the Congress that passed the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, and was rejected The Senate Report recorded the Act's purpose to codify the holding of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in In re Western Liquid Asphalt Cases, supra \" We therefore see no problem of double recovery, and we believe that if this difficulty should arise in some other connection, the district court will be able to fashion relief accordingly In addition to the court's control over its decree, numerous devices exist We note that the consolidation of cases, which has already occurred, is one means of averting duplicitous awards The short, four-year statute of limitations is another later suits, after 762 final judgment herein, are unlikely 15 U S C § 15b In other cases, it may be that statutory interpleader, 28 U S C § 1335, could be used by antitrust defendants to avoid double liability If necessary, special masters may be appointed to handle complex cases Finally, there are the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel and procedures for compulsory joinder The day is long past when courts, particularly federal courts, will deny relief to a deserving plaintiff merely because of procedural difficulties or problems of apportioning damages ' 762 \"We would prefer to place the burden of proving apportionment upon appellees, rather than deny all recovery to appellants Such a burden would be the consequence of appellees' illegal acts, not appellants' suits Where the choice is between a windfall to intermediaries or letting guilty defendants go free, liability is imposed Hanover Shoe, supra, 392 U S at 494 So, too, between ultimate purchasers and defendants \" S Rep No 94-803, p 44 (1976), quoting 487 F 2d, at 201 (citation omitted) Moreover, the possibility of multiple recovery arises in only two situations (1) where suits by direct and indirect purchasers are pending at the same time but in different courts and (2) where additional suits are filed after an award of damages based on the same violation in a prior suit [19] In the first situation, the United States, Brief as Amicus Curiae 25, cogently points out that district courts may make use of the alternatives suggested by the Manual for Complex Litigation, 1 (pt 2) J Moore, Federal Practice (1976) district courts may use the intradistrict transfer power created by 28 U S C § 1404 (b), coordinate pretrial proceedings of cases pending in 763 different districts, or transfer cases to a single district pursuant to § 1404 (a) In addition, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation is empowered by 28 U S C § 1407 to transfer cases involving common questions of fact to any district for coordinated pretrial proceedings upon its determination that the transfer \"will be for the convenience of parties and witnesses and will promote the just and efficient conduct of such actions \" After pretrial transfers under this section, cases can be consolidated and transferred to the same district for trial pursuant to the transfer power under § 1404 (a) [20] A further device mentioned in Western Liquid Asphalt is statutory interpleader under 28 U S C § 1335, by which the defendant can bring all potential plaintiffs into the same court and require them to litigate inter se to determine their appropriate shares of the total recovery [21] 763 True, there is a greater hypothetical danger of multiple recovery where suits are independently instituted after an earlier suit based on the same violation has proceeded to judgment [22] But even here the likelihood that defendants 764 will be subjected to multiple liability is, as a practical matter, remote The extended nature of antitrust actions, often involving years of discovery, combines with the short four-year statute of limitations to make it impractical for potential plaintiffs to sit on their rights until after entry of judgment in the earlier suit 764 5/2/22, 10 11 AM Illinois Brick Co v Illinois, 431

weakens the effectiveness of the private treble-damages action as a deterrent to antitrust violations by, in most cases, precluding consumers from recovering for antitrust injuries For in many instances, consumers, although indirect purchasers, bear the brunt of antitrust violations To deny them an opportunity for recovery is particularly indefensible when direct purchasers, acting as middlemen, and ordinarily reluctant to sue their suppliers,[23] pass on the bulk of their increased costs to consumers farther along the chain of distribution Congress has given us a clear signal that § 4 is not to be read to have the restrictive 765 scope ascribed to it by the Court today I would follow the congressional understanding and therefore would affirm [24] 765 MR JUSTICE BLACKMUN, dissenting I regard MR JUSTICE BRENNAN'S dissenting opinion as persuasive and convincing, and I joint it without hesitation I add these few sentences only to say that I think the

case, and were it not \"on the books,\" I am positive that the Court today would be affirming, perhaps unanimously, the judgment of the Court of Appeals The policy behind the Antitrust Acts and all the signs point in that direction, and a conclusion in favor of indirect purchasers who could demonstrate injury would almost be compelled But Hanover Shoe is on the books, and the Court feels that it must be \"consistent\" in its application of passon That, 766 for me, is a wooden approach, and it is entirely inadequate when considered in the light of the objectives of the Sherman and Clayton Acts

or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefore in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee \" [2] The Court cited, as an example of when a pass-on defense might be permitted, the situation where \"an overcharged buyer has a preexisting cost-plus' contract, thus making it easy to prove that he has not been damaged  \" 392 U S , at 494 See infra, at 735-736 [3] The Court explained the economic uncertainties and complexities involved in proving pass-on as follows \"A wide range of factors influence a company's pricing policies Normally the impact of a single change in the relevant conditions cannot be measured after the fact indeed a businessman may be unable to state whether, had one fact been different (a single supply less expensive, general economic conditions more buoyant, or the labor market tighter, for example), he would have chosen a different price Equally difficult to determine, in the real economic world rather than an economist's hypothetical model, is what effect a change in a company's price will have on its total sales Finally, costs per unit for a different volume of total sales are hard to estimate Even if it could be shown that the buyer raised his price in response to, and in the amount of, the overcharge and that his margin of profit and total sales had not thereafter declined, there would remain the nearly insuperable difficulty of demonstrating that the particular plaintiff could not or would not have raised his prices absent the overcharge or maintained the higher price had the overcharge been discontinued Since establishing the applicability of the passing-on defense would require a convincing showing of each of these virtually unascertainable figures, the task would normally prove insurmountable On the other hand, it is not unlikely that if the existence of the defense is generally confirmed, antitrust defendants will frequently seek to establish its applicability Treble-damage actions would often require additional long and complicated proceedings involving massive evidence and complicated theories \" 392 U S , at 492-493 (Footnote omitted ) [4] Section 1 of the Sherman Act, c 647, 26 Stat 209, as amended, 15 U S C § 1, provides in relevant part \"Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal  \" [5] Private treble-damages actions brought by masonry contractors, general contractors, and private builders were settled, without prejudice to this suit 536 F 2d, at 1164 [6] The responses to petitioners' interrogatories indicated that only four of the plaintiffs represented by the State purchased concrete block directly from one of the petitioners 67 F R D 461, 463 (ND Ill 1975) Only 7% of the 700 public entities named as plaintiffs were apparently able to state the cost of the

percent of the total cost of the project Id , at 21 n [ ] [7] The District Court based its grant of summary judgment against the indirect purchaser plaintiffs not on the ground that this Court's construction of § 4 in Hanover Shoe barred their attempt to show that the masonry and general contractors passed on the overcharge to them, but rather on the ground that these indirect purchasers lacked standing to sue for an overcharge on one product—concrete block —that was incorporated by the masonry and general contractors into an entirely new and different product—a building 67 F R D , at

States as Amicus Curiae 25 Various procedural devices, such as the Multidistrict Litigation Act, 28 U S C § 1407, and statutory interpleader, 28 U S C § 1335, are relied upon to bring indirect and direct purchasers together in one action in order to apportion damages among them and thereby reduce the risk of duplicative recovery These procedural devices cannot protect against multiple liability where the direct purchasers have already recovered by obtaining a judgment or by settling, as is more likely (and as occurred here, see n 5, supra) acknowledging that the risk of multiple recoveries is inevitably increased by allowing offensive but not defensive use of pass-on, e g , Comment, 123 U Pa L Rev , supra, at 994, proponents of this approach ultimately fall back on the argument that it is better for the defendant to pay sixfold or more damages than for an injured party to go uncompensated E g , Comment, 72 Colum L Rev , supra, at 411 Tr of Oral Arg 58 (\"a little slopover on the shoulders of the wrongdoers  is acceptable\") We do not find this risk acceptable Moreover, even if ways could be found to bring all potential plaintiffs together in one huge action, the complexity thereby introduced into treble-damages proceeding argues strongly for retaining the Hanover Shoe rule See part III, infra [12] That this rationale was more important in the decision to bar the pass-on defense than the second reason—the concern that if passon defenses were permitted indirect purchasers would lack the incentive to sue and antitrust violators would retain their ill-gotten gains, see supra, at 725-726, is shown by the fact that the Court recognized an exception for pre-existing cost-plus contracts, which \"mak[e] it easy to prove that [the direct purchaser] has not been damaged \" 392 U S , at 494 (Emphasis added ) The amount of the stake that the customers of the direct purchaser have in a lawsuit against the overcharge is not likely to depend on whether they buy under a cost-plus contract or in a competitive market, but the Court allowed a pass-on defense in the former situation because the pre-existing cost-plus contract makes easy the normally complicated task of demonstrating that the overcharge has not been absorbed by the direct purchaser See Note, The Effect of Hanover Shoe on the Offensive Use of the Passing-on Doctrine, 46 So Cal L Rev 98, 108 (1972) [13] Offensive use of pass-on by the last purchaser in the distribution chain is simpler in one respect than defensive use of pass-on against a direct purchaser that sells a product to other customers In the latter case, even if the defendant shows that as a result of the overcharge the direct purchaser increased its price by the full amount of the overcharge, the direct purchaser may still claim injury from a reduction in the volume of its sales caused by its higher prices This additional element of injury from reduced volume is not present in the suit by the final purchaser of the overcharged goods, where the issue regarding injury will be whether the defendant's overcharge caused the plaintiff to pay a higher price for whatever it purchased But the final purchaser still will have to trace the overcharge through each step in the distribution chain In our view, the difficulty of reconstructing the pricing decisions of intermediate purchasers at each step in the chain beyond the direct purchaser generally will outweigh any gain in simplicity from not having to litigate the effects of the passed-on overcharge on the direct purchaser's volume [14] We are urged to defer to evidence in the legislative history of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, 90 Stat 1394-1396, 15 U S C § 15c et seq (1976 ed ), that Congress understood Hanover Shoe as applying

assumed that the issue of offensive use of pass-on under § 4 would be resolved favorably to plaintiffs by this Court See 122 Cong Rec H10295 (daily ed , Sept 16, 1976) Congress made clear, however, that this legislation did not alter the definition of which overcharged persons were injured within the meaning of § 4 It simply created a new procedural device—parens patriae actions by States on behalf of their citizens—to enforce existing rights of recovery under § 4 The House Report quoted above stated that the parens patriae provision \"creates no new substantive liability\" the relevant language of the newly enacted § 4C (a) of the Clayton Act tracks that of existing § 4 showing that it was intended only as \"an alternative means  for the vindication of existing substantive claims \"

Broadcasting Co v FCC, 395 U S 367, 380-381 (1969) (language in 1959 amendment to § 315 of the Communications Act approved fairness doctrine adopted by FCC under the \"public interest\" standard of the original Act) Here, by contrast, Congress borrowed the language of § 4 in adding the parens patriae section The views expressed by particular legislators as to the meaning of that language in § 4 \"cannot serve to change the legislative intent of Congress  since the statements were [made] after passage of the [Clayton] Act ' \" Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U S 102, 132 (1974), quoting National Woodwork Mfrs Assn v NLRB, 386 U S 612, 639 n 34 (1967) While we do not lightly disagree with the reading of Hanover Shoe urged by these legislators, we think the construction of § 4 adopted in that decision cannot be applied for the exclusive benefit of plaintiffs Should Congress disagree with this result, it may, of course, amend the section to change it But it has not done so in the recent parens patriae legislation [15] In a separate trial pursuant to Fed Rule Civ Proc 42 (b), the District Court held that the defendant shoe machinery manufacturer was not permitted to assert a pass-on defense against its customer 185 F Supp 826 (MD Pa ), aff'd, 281 F 2d 481 (CA3), cert denied, 364 U S 901 (1960) The District Court indicated that pass-on defenses were barred against \"consumers\" who use the defendant's product to make their own but not against \"middlemen\" who simply resell the defendant's product 185 F Supp , at 830-831 Both on interlocutory appeal and after trial on the merits, the Court of Appeals affirmed on the basis of the District Court's reasoning See 392 U S at 488 n 6 [16] Another situation in which market forces have been superseded and the pass-on defense might be permitted is where the direct purchaser is owned or controlled by its customer Cf Perkins v Standard Oil Co , 395 U S 642, 648 (1969) In re Western Liquid Asphalt Cases, 487 F 2d, at 197, 199 [17] The sole dissenting Justice in Hanover Shoe did not reach the pass-on question 392 U S , at 513 [18] In this Part, we assume that use of pass-on will be permitted symmetrically, if at all This assumption, of course, reduces the substantial risk of multiple liability for defendants that is posed by allowing indirect purchasers to recover for the overcharge passed on to them while at the same time allowing direct purchasers automatically to collect the entire overcharge See supra, at 730-731 But the possibility of inconsistent judgments obtained by conflicting claimants remains nonetheless Even this residual possibility justifies bringing potential and actual claimants together in one action if possible [19] See n 11, supra Interpleader under Fed Rule Civ Proc 22 (1) often would be unavailable because service of process for rule interpleader, as contrasted with statutory interpleader, does not run nationwide See 3A J Moore, Federal Practice ¶ 22 04[2] (1974) [20] For example, a condition precedent for invoking statutory interpleader is the posting of a bond for the amount in dispute, 28 U S C § 1335 (a) (2), see 3A J Moore, supra, ¶ 22 10, and a defendant may be unwilling to put up a bond for the huge amounts normally claimed in multiple-party treble-damages suits For a discussion of other circumstances in which statutory interpleader may be \"impractical,\" see McGuire, The Passing-On Defense and the Right of Remote Purchasers to Recover Treble Damages under Hanover Shoe, 33 U Pitt L Rev 177, 197-198 (1971) [21] Rule 19 (a) provides in part \"A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the action if (1) in his absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) he claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in his absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of his claimed interest \" 5/2/22, 10 11 AM Illinois Brick Co v Illinois, 431 US 720 - Supreme Court 1977 - Google Scholar https //scholar

aff'd sub nom Mangano v American Radiator Standard Sanitary Corp , 438 F 2d 1187 (CA3 1971) (suit against manufacturers of plumbing fixtures on behalf of all homeowners in the United States) There often will be more levels of distribution or manufacture between the defendant and the ultimate consumers than the two levels (masonry and general contractors) in this case For example, in Philadelphia Housing Auth , supra, the plaintiffs included homeowners who had bought used rather than new homes and who therefore had to show that each time their houses changed hands the sellers passed on part of the plumbing manufacturers' original overcharge 50 F R D , at 19-20, 25-26 Treble-damages suits by ultimate consumers against any of the manufacturers of industrial raw materials or equipment that have been charged in recent Government price-fixing suits would involve not only several levels within a distribution chain, but also several separate chains of distribution for example, chromite sand is used to make ingots, ingots are used to make steel, and steel is used to make consumer products Handler Blechman, supra n 7, at 640 n 77, and see id , at 636-637 (citing Justice Department price-fixing suits against defendants far removed from consumers) [24] E g , Donson Stores, Inc v American Bakeries Co , 58 F R D 481 (SDNY 1973) (motion to intervene by a putative class of 20 million consumers of bread in treble-damages action against bread manufacturers) Cf Handler Blechman, supra, n 7, at 653 (arguing that the effect of legislation authorizing States to bring treble-damages actions on behalf of their citizens, see n 14, supra, will be to interject claims on behalf of large classes of consumers into treble-damages suits brought by middlemen) Thus in this case the plaintiff housing authorities, App 20, presumably have passed on part of the alleged overcharge to their tenants and subtenants, who would have to be brought into the suit before damages could be fairly apportioned [25] An overcharge imposed by an antitrust violator or group of violators on their customers is analytically equivalent to an excise tax imposed on the violator's product in the amount of the overcharge The effect of such an overcharge can be calculated using the economic theorems for the incidence of an excise tax See Schaefer, Passing-On Theory in Antitrust Treble Damage Actions An Economic and Legal Analysis, 16 Wm Mary L Rev 883, 887, 893 (1975), and sources cited in id , at 887 n 21 [26] Thus, in the instant case respondents have offered to prove that general and masonry contractors calculate their bids by adding a percentage markup to the cost of their materials, Brief for Respondents 20-23, rather than by attempting to equate marginal cost and marginal revenue as required by an explicit profit-maximizing strategy [27] MR JUSTICE BRENNAN in dissent argues that estimating a passee's damages requires nothing more than estimating what the passer's price would have been absent the violation, and suggests that apportioning the overcharge throughout the distribution chain is \"no different from and no more complicated\" than the initial task of estimating the amount of the overcharge itself Post, at 758-759, and n 14 But as the dissent recognizes, post, at 749 n 3 unless the indirect purchaser is at the end of the distribution chain it can claim damages not only from the portion of the overcharge it absorbs but also from the portion it passes on, which causes a reduction in sales volume under less than perfectly inelastic demand conditions See n 13, supra The difficulties of the task urged upon us by the dissenters cannot be so easily brushed aside In any event, as we understand the dissenters' argument, it reduces to the proposition that because antitrust cases are already complicated there is little harm in making them more so We disagree [28] See, e g , West Virginia v Chas Pfizer Co , 314 F Supp 710, 745-746 (SDNY

this problem of compensating indirect purchasers for small injuries Post, at 764 n 23 Quite to the contrary, the Act \"recognizes that rarely, if ever, will all potential claimants actually come

as sdt=2006 20/22 parens patriae action that is not used to compensate the actual injuries of antitrust victims is to be used as \"a civil penalty  deposited with the State as general revenues,\" Clayton Act § 4E (2), 15 U S C § 15e (2) (1976 ed ), enacted by the 1976 Act, or \"for some public purposes benefiting, as closely as possible, the class of injured persons,\" such as reducing the price of the overcharged goods in future sales H R Rep No 94-499, supra, at 16 That Congress chose to provide such innovative methods of distributing damages awarded in a parens patriae action under newly enacted § 4C of the Clayton Act, 15 U S C § 15c (1976 ed ), does not eliminate the obstacles to compensating indirect purchasers bringing traditional suits under § 4 [1] The block was sold to various general and special contractors who had successfully bid to construct public buildings The State was thus an indirect purchaser of the block [2] There is, of course, a point beyond which antitrust defendants should not be held responsible for the remote consequences of their actions See the discussion in Part III, infra, at 760-761 [3] The portion of an illegal overcharge that a direct purchaser can pass on depends upon the elasticity of demand in the relevant product market If the market is relatively inelastic, he may pass on a relatively large portion If demand is relatively elastic, he may not be able to raise his price and will have to absorb the increase, making it up by decreasing other costs or increasing sales volume It is extremely unlikely that a middleman could pass on the entire cost increase But rarely would he have to absorb the entire increase R Posner, Antitrust Cases, Economic Notes, and Other Materials 147-149 (1974) [4] The opinion recognizes that \"there might be situations—for instance, when an overcharged buyer has a pre-existing cost-plus' contract, thus making it easy to prove that he has not been damaged—where the considerations requiring that the passing-on defense not be permitted in this case would not be present \" 392 U S , at 494 [5] Hanover Shoe, did not involve the consumers of the plaintiff's shoes, to whom the overcharge allegedly was passed United's passing-on argument is referred to as \"defensive\" passing on The State's position, seeking recovery of illegal overcharges allegedly passed on to it and its citizens, is referred to as \"offensive\" passing on [6] Hanover alleged that United monopolized the shoe machinery industry in violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act by its practice of leasing but refusing to sell its shoemaking machinery [7] In Darnell-Taenzer, shippers brought suit for reparations against a railroad claiming that the railroad had charged unreasonable rates The railroad argued that the shippers had in turn passed on to their customers any excess over the reasonable rate [8] \"[T]he impact of a single change in the relevant conditions cannot be measured after the fact indeed a businessman may be unable to state whether, had one fact been different  , he would have chosen a different price  \" 392 U S , at 492-493 The Court further observed that it is equally difficult to ascertain \"what effect a change in a company's price will have on its total sales\" and it is all but impossible to demonstrate that the particular plaintiff \"could not or would not have raised his prices absent the overcharge or maintained the higher price had the overcharge been discontinued \" Id , at 493 See generally Posner, supra, n 3, at 147-149 [9] The pass-on defense in Hanover Shoe was asserted by a defendant against whom a prima facie case of liability had already been made out The Clayton Act provides \"A final judgment  rendered in any civil or criminal proceeding brought by or on behalf of the United States under the antitrust laws  shall be prima facie evidence against such defendant  \" 15 U S C § 16 (a) The Government had secured a judgment against United in United States v United Shoe Machinery Corp , 110 F Supp 295 (Mass 1953), summarily aff'd, 347 U S 521 (1954) [10] Commentators almost unanimously conclude that, despite Hanover Shoe, § 4 should be construed to authorize indirect purchasers to recover upon proof that increases were passed on to them See, e g , Comment, Standing to Sue in Antitrust Cases The Offensive Use of

[12] The fact that damages are trebled both aids deterrence and provides the incentive of compensation, since it encourages suits for relatively minor injuries 5/2/22, 10 11 AM Illinois Brick Co v

rejected earlier Court of Appeals and District Court decisions erecting standing barriers to suits by indirect purchasers and chose instead to pattern the Act \"after such innovative decisions as In re Western Liquid Asphalt Cases, 487 F 2d 191 (9th Cir 1973) In re Master Key Litigation, 1973 Trade Cases ¶ 74,680 and 1975 Trade Cases ¶ 60,377 (DC Conn ) State of Illinois v Ampress Brick Co , 1975

Virginia v Charles Pfizer Co , 440 F 2d 1079 (2d Cir 1971) \" Congress accepted these decisions as correctly stating the law S Rep No 94-803, pp 42-43 (1976) [14] In Hanover Shoe, the measure of damages was the difference between the amount Hanover paid for the lease and the amount it would have paid had United agreed to sell the machinery It has been suggested that the burden of demonstrating a pass-on may be no more difficult or speculative than the plaintiff's initial task of proving an overcharge in the first instance See Pollock, Automatic Treble Damages and the Passing-on Defense The Hanover Shoe Decision, 13 Antitrust Bull 1183, 1210 (1968) [15] One commentator has suggested that, in deciding whether to permit recovery by indirect purchasers in a particular case, courts should consider the number of intervening hands the product has passed through and the extent of its change in the process P Areeda, Antitrust Analysis Problems, Text, Cases 75 (2d ed 1974) [16] This holding is consistent with the Court's continuing concern for the effectiveness of the treble-damages action, which has been sustained even when the plaintiff was \"no less morally reprehensible than the defendant\" with whom he had conspired Perma Life Mufflers, Inc v International Parts Corp , 392 U S 134, 139 (1968) [17] See, e g , Loeb v Eastman Kodak Co , 183 F 704 (CA3 1910) [18] Earlier this Term, Brunswick Corp v Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc , disallowed a treble-damages recovery, stating that in order to recover antitrust plaintiffs must prove \"antitrust injury, which is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes [the] defendants' acts unlawful \" 429 U S , at 489 At least one Court of Appeals has rephrased the target-area test in terms of whether the injury to the plaintiff is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant's illegal conduct Mulvey v Samuel Goldwyn Productions, 433 F 2d 1073 (CA9 1970), cert denied, 402 U S 923 (1971) [19] If direct and indirect purchasers bring suit in the same court, the cases may be consolidated and damages allocated in accordance with Fed Rule Civ Proc 42 (a) See West Virginia v Chas Pfizer Co , 440 F 2d 1079 (CA2 1971) [20] For a discussion of this process, see Note, The Judicial Panel and the Conduct of Multidistrict Litigation, 87 Harv L Rev 1001 (1974) Comment, The Experience of Transferee Courts Under the Multidistrict Litigation Act, 39 U Chi L Rev 588 (1972) [21] Petitioners suggest that interpleader may be an impractical alternative for some defendants, since it requires a defendant to complicate the suit by bringing in ultimate consumers and to post bond for the amount in controversy See 28 U S C § 1335 (a) (2) Although § 1335 clearly places a burden upon defendants who elect to use it in order to avoid potential multiple liability, that burden is not unique to antitrust cases, and Congress has clearly indicated that it considers the burden justified See S Rep No 94-803, p 44 (1976) [22] The problem of potential multiple recoveries is not present in this case All suits against petitioners were filed in the Northern District of Illinois Petitioners never sought consolidation under Fed Rule Civ Proc 42 (a) and stipulated in settlements with direct purchasers that the settlement would not affect the rights of indirect purchasers [23] The opinion for the Court \"recognize[s] that direct purchasers sometimes may refrain from bringing a treble-damages suit for fear of disrupting relations with their suppliers,\" but concludes that \"on balance, and until there are clear directions from Congress to the contrary, we conclude that the legislative purpose in creating a group of private attorneys general' to enforce the antitrust laws  is better served by holding direct purchasers to be injured to the full extent of the overcharge paid by them than by attempting to apportion the overcharge among all that may have absorbed a part of it \" Ante, at 746 But the intent of Congress in enacting the parens patriae provision of the 1976 Act was clearly to provide a mechanism to permit recovery by consumers, and this purpose is not furthered by a rule that will keep most consumers out of court The Court's opinion further observes that \"[m]any of the indirect purchasers barred from asserting pass-on claims  have such a small stake in the lawsuit that even if they were to recover as part of a class, only a small fraction would be likely to come forward to collect their damages \" Ante, at 747 Yet it was precisely because of judicially perceived weaknesses in the class action as a device for consumer recovery for antitrust violations that Congress enacted the parens patriae provision of the 1976 Act [24] Abundant authority sanctions deference to congressional indications in subsequent legislation regarding the congressional meaning in earlier Acts worded consistently with that meaning NLRB v Bell Aerospace Co , 416 U S 267, 275 (1974) Red Lion Broadcasting Co v FCC, 395 U S 367, 380 (1969) FHA v The Darlington, Inc , 358 U S 84, 90 (1958) United States v Stafoff, 260 U S

\"particular legislators\" who participated in the enactment of a statute cannot change its meaning, see Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U S 102, 132 (1974), quoting National Woodwork

{"id":16,"text":"The Law and Economics of the Economic Expert Witness Richard A Posner I t is necessary at the outset to distinguish between economic expertise and economic expert witnesses That economic expertise has a large and fruitful role to play in the law seems undeniable There is a remarkable isomorphism between legal doctrine and economic theory The isomorphism becomes an identity when, as in antitrust (but not only there), the law adopts an explicitly economic criterion of legality The isomorphic relation is illustrated by Judge Learned Hand’s formula of negligence in United States v Carroll Towing Co (159 F 2d 169 (2d Cir 1947)) an injurer is negligent if the burden of the precaution (B) that would have averted the accident was less than the magnitude of the harm (L, for loss) resulting from the accident, discounted by the probability (P) that the accident would occur if the precaution was not taken that is, if B , PL This bit of algebra, itself a paraphrase of verbal formulations of the negligence standard, is readily translated into a formula for optimal care derived by minimizing the cost function A(c) 5 B(c) 1 P(c) L, where c is cost, A(c) the total costs of accidents and accident prevention as a function of c, and B, P, and L are as before Minimizing the combined costs of prevention and accidents yields—with certain plausible assumptions laid out in Landes and Posner (1987, pp 58–60, 87)—the rule that social cost is minimized when the marginal cost of taking precautions is equal to the marginal gain from the precautions, as measured by the cost of the loss if the accident occurs multiplied by the probability of the accident given the level of precautions taken This is simply a precise economic formulation of the Hand formula the substance is unchanged There are many other important examples of isomorphism between legal doctrine and economic theory indeed, I regard it as pervasive (Posner, 1998) Lawyers could do much more to educate judges concerning it, and for that they y Richard A Posner is Chief Judge, U S Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and Senior Lecturer, University of Chicago Law School, Chicago, Illinois Journal of Economic Perspectives—Volume 13, Number 2—Spring 1999—Pages 91–99 need either the help of economists or a fair amount of economic training themselves But I will not dwell on this point because it is not the domain of the expert witness A witness is not an advisor or consultant, but someone who testiﬁes—who offers what the law regards as “evidence ” The law uses the term rather narrowly The considerations, including the economic considerations, that go to shape legal doctrine—that go for example to determine whether negligence or strict liability shall be the legal regime for some class of accidents, or whether tying agreements shall be illegal per se, or whether a contribution to a spouse’s human capital shall be considered property in a divorce proceeding, or whether punitive damages shall ever be awarded in a case of an efﬁcient breach of contract—are not considered questions to be decided by taking testimony and testing its accuracy by crossexamination, but by reference to general considerations of law and policy The domain of evidence is the proof of particular facts in a case, such as, in a negligence case, whether the defendant did or did not take cost-justiﬁed precautions to avoid the accident The expert will not be permitted to testify that a person disabled in an accident in which the injurer was at fault should be entitled to recover the present value of any lost future earnings, but will be permitted to testify to the calculation of that present value from information about wage proﬁles, longevity, inﬂation, interest rates, risk, discounting, and so forth The expert will not be permitted to testify that antitrust law should not forbid price ﬁxing, but will be permitted to testify that the defendants’ pricing behavior is inconsistent with their having agreed to ﬁx prices or that it had no effect on the average price paid by the plaintiff The expert will not be permitted to testify about whether the law should prohibit sex discrimination, but will be permitted to testify about potential causes of the difference between men’s and women’s wages that are unrelated to discrimination by a speciﬁc employer for example, differences in investment in human capital The law governing the use of expert witnesses (including economists, who are not treated separately by the law) is set forth in Article VII of the Federal Rules of Evidence The rules apply only to the federal courts, but the corresponding rules for state courts are similar Essentially, Article VII permits anyone who has relevant expertise to be classiﬁed as an expert witness The principal signiﬁcance of the classiﬁcation is that, unlike an ordinary witness, an expert witness is allowed to offer an opinion rather than being limited to testifying from personal knowledge In other words, the expert is allowed to apply expert knowledge to the facts Those facts need not be limited to those that can be proved by evidence admissible under the rules of evidence, which are rules designed mainly to shield inexperienced factﬁnders (the jurors) from evidence that might confuse, distract, or inﬂame them the facts on which an expert bases an opinion need only be, in the words of Rule 703, the “type [of facts or data] reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular ﬁeld in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject,” although the expert must make the facts or data which are relied on available to opposing counsel for cross-examination A little-used provision, Rule 706, permits the judge to appoint an expert witness to be a court witness, a neutral (Lee, 1988) it is little used, in part, because judges lack conﬁdence in their ability to pick a neutral Later, 92 Journal of Economic Perspectives I’ll suggest how they might overcome this problem Other expert witnesses are hired by the parties and compensated at whatever rate the party and the witness agree on The only limitation is that the witness may not receive a contingent fee, that is, a fee the size of which depends on the outcome of the case Criticisms and Responses Concerning the Use of Expert Witnesses There are several recurrent criticisms of the use of expert witnesses (usefully summarized in Lee, 1988) They are made with reference to expert witnesses in general, but they do not exclude economists All these criticisms belong to the genre of economic theory known as “agency costs ” The court corresponds to the principal in an ordinary principal-agent relation, and the expert witness to the agent The parties have asymmetric information The agent knows more the principal knows this and takes steps to try to align the agent’s incentives with those of the principal The ﬁrst criticism is that expert witnesses paid by the respective parties are bound to be partisans (“hired guns”) rather than being disinterested, and hence presumptively truthful, or at least honest, witnesses This factor alone does not distinguish expert witnesses sharply from a number of other common types of witnesses, notably the parties themselves but the difference, and the second criticism, is that expert witnesses, it is feared, can mislead judges and juries more readily than lay witnesses can because they are more difﬁcult to pick apart on cross-examination—they can hide behind an impenetrable wall of esoteric knowledge Even if an expert witness is demolished on cross-examination by a lawyer who has been carefully prepped by another expert, the jury may not understand the questions and answers given on cross-examination well enough to realize that the expert has been demolished The concern with tilt and the concern with the “bounded rationality” of the trier of fact interact The expert has both motive and means of slanting the truth in favor of the client Third, and related to both preceding points, it is believed that opposing experts often cancel each other out the jury cannot choose between them, so it ignores them and decides the case on the basis of the nonexpert evidence In such a case the expert evidence is wasted The ﬁrst concern (excessive partisanship) does not seem to me very grave with respect to economic witnesses when they are testifying in areas in which there is a substantial professional consensus (a vital qualiﬁcation, however, as we’ll see) There are four reasons for my conclusion 1 1) Because most expert witnesses, including most economic expert witnesses, are repeat players (unlike most lay witnesses), they have, like other potentially 1 Let me declare my interest before I became a judge in 1981, I testiﬁed as an economic expert witness in several judicial and administrative proceedings, and I was a founder of Lexecon Inc , a consulting ﬁrm that specializes in the provision of economic testimony in litigation I severed all ties with Lexecon when I became a judge Richard A Posner 93 disloyal agents, a ﬁnancial interest in creating and preserving a reputation for being honest and competent 2 Any public judicial criticism of a witness—in an opinion, whether or not formally published, or even in the transcript of a trial or other hearing—is apt to impair the witness’s career as a witness, sometimes fatally, because the criticism is likely to be mentioned in the cross-examination of the witness in any future case 3 Furthermore, many economic expert witnesses are employed by consulting ﬁrms, which have a corporate reputation that can be damaged by the errors of their employees There is a danger that judicial criticism of an expert may be uninformed But, if so, the negative impact on the expert’s reputation will be less, since the next time the expert testiﬁes will offer an opportunity to rebut the criticism if confronted with it during cross-examination The foregoing is not a complete answer to the criticism, because it is the repeat player who also has an incentive to please clients so as to be rehired in the future The one-time expert witness presumably has nothing to lose or gain from testifying in a partisan manner, given the impermissibility of contingent fees for expert witnesses 2) An expert witness who has a record of academic publication will be “kept honest” by the fact that any attempt to repudiate his academic work on the stand will invite devastating cross-examination This implies that a warning ﬂag should go up whenever the expert witness either has no record of academic publication or is testifying about matters on which he has never published Not only is such an economist less likely to testify truthfully, but the lawyer’s choice of that person as an expert implies that the lawyer was unable to ﬁnd a knowledgeable economist willing to testify in support of the client’s position 3) Because of the adversarial character of the American system of litigation, and the requirement that the expert disclose evidence during the pretrial discovery process and thus before the trial begins (and in machine-readable form), expert evidence is subject to intense critical scrutiny, which should deter irresponsible expert testimony In the case of economics, where the tradition of replicating previous academic studies is weaker than in the natural sciences, a study conducted for purposes of litigation is likely to receive more intense scrutiny than an academic study, even one published in a refereed journal 4) An expert witness’s evidence is inadmissible if it does not satisfy the methodological standards in the expert’s ﬁeld4—something that is easier for the 2 More than 600 economists belong to the National Association of Forensic Economics the average member derives 42 percent of his income from forensic work and 67 percent of the average member’s business is repeat business (Ward and Olson, 1993, pp 1, 2, 8) I do not know what fraction of forensic economists belong to the association, or how representative they are—but I think not very, as they are primarily involved in personal-injury litigation and I believe do not include the more prestigious economists who testify in antitrust, securities and other commercial litigation The principal role, to date, of the economic expert witness in personal injury litigation has been to testify concerning damages, including lost earnings and “hedonic” damages (damages for loss of utility) 3 Ireland, Johnson and Taylor (1997, p 156) write “A favorable mention in a reported case is of real beneﬁt to a forensic economist, while an unfavorable mention is a major cost ” 4 For cases supporting this requirement see, for example, Daubert v Merrill Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc , 509 U S 579 (1993) People Who Care v Rockford Board of Education, 111 F 3d 528, 537 (7th Cir 1997) 94 Journal of Economic Perspectives judge to determine than whether the analysis is correct This rule acts as a screen against “junk science ” The mesh of the screen may actually be too ﬁne, especially for economic expert evidence, much of which is statistical There is some judicial reluctance to admit into evidence statistical studies that do not pass the 5 percent test of statistical signiﬁcance 5 This test is of course standard in economics, though economists (and other social scientists) often interpret results signiﬁcant at the 10 percent level as supporting their hypotheses and if the results are signiﬁcant at the 2 percent or 1 percent level often point out that these results are more robust than those that are signiﬁcant only at the 5 percent level Bayes’s theorem casts doubt on whether the 5 percent convention should control in the courtroom If it did, this would imply that eyewitness testimony, too, should be inadmissible unless the probability that the testimony would have been given even if the event testiﬁed to had not occurred was less than 5 percent The higher the signiﬁcance level of a statistical study, the more reliable it is as evidence and the lower that level, the less reliable it is but it can be relatively unreliable yet still affect a rational judge or jury’s priors Granted, a low signiﬁcance level may reﬂect an unsound method of statistical estimation, an incorrect speciﬁcation of the hypothesis being tested, a small sample size, or the omission of relevant variables Any such danger signs may require a deep discounting of the reliability of the study but that is true of any evidence If the study has been conducted responsibly and withstood a hammering from the opponent’s expert, yet the signiﬁcance level does not reach the conventional 5 percent level, it would not be a good reason for excluding the evidence that a social scientist who stretches the conventions of the discipline by reporting results that do not attain the conventional signiﬁcance level must be untrustworthy The convention is rooted in considerations that have no direct relevance to litigation, such as the need to ration pages in scientiﬁc journals Fears that jurors are dazzled by evidence involving explicit probability estimates and so give it more weight than a good Bayesian would do appear to be unfounded jurors appear to give statistical evidence less weight than they should (Smith et al , 1996 Salop, 1987) But one must not overlook the cost of weak statistical evidence The less robust the results of a statistical study offered as evidence, the more time will have to be spent at trial exploring the design of the study Given the difﬁculty that judges and jurors have in understanding and weighing statistical evidence, there is an argument (akin to that for the hearsay rule) for excluding statistical evidence that the relevant profession, for whatever reason, considers weak The second concern with the use of expert witnesses—the concern with intelligibility once the evidence has been admitted—has undoubted merit, but is easily overstated because it ignores the lawyer’s incentive to call persuasive witnesses If a witness cannot communicate in a way that the court understands, the 5 This reluctance is based, as noted in Ireland (1998, p 237), on an interpretation of Hazelwood School District v United States (433 U S 299 (1977))—see note 17 on p 311 in particular—and Castaneda v Partida (430 U S 482 (1977))—see note 17 on p 496 However, the interpretation is incorrect See Ashenfelter and Oaxaca (1987) The Law and Economics of the Economic Expert Witness 95 testimony is unlikely to be persuasive This is a particularly important consideration in jury trials, because jurors give less weight to credentials than to clarity (Shuman, Champagne and Whitaker, 1996, p 379), and leads me to predict that jurors may understand expert testimony as well as judges do that is, the lawyer will adjust the complexity of expert testimony to the comprehension of the audience This is not a complete answer Econometrics is such a difﬁcult subject that it is unrealistic to expect the average judge or juror to be able to understand all the criticisms of an econometric study, no matter how skillful the econometrician is in explaining a study to a lay audience (Rubinfeld, 1985) 6 This problem cannot be solved, but it could be elided, by more frequent appointment of court-appointed experts Concern with the judge’s ability to pick a genuine neutral to be the court’s expert could be alleviated by borrowing a leaf from arbitration A common method of selecting arbitrators is for each party to choose an arbitrator and for the two arbitrators to then choose a neutral, who generally casts the deciding vote The parties’ experts could, similarly, agree on a neutral expert who would be appointed by the court, as proposed in Rubinfeld (1985, p 1096) The views of the neutral expert would quite properly have decisive weight with the jury It would not matter whether the jurors understood the neutral fully the conclusions of the agreedupon expert would be credible because of the combination of neutrality and expertise You don’t have to understand a proposition to be justiﬁed in believing it you need only be able to repose a justiﬁed trust in the truthfulness and expertise of the person who assures you that the proposition is true The third concern about expert testimony—that opposing experts often cancel each other out—would be alleviated if, instead of testifying, they selected a neutral expert Even when there is no neutral, it might seem that whenever the opposing experts canceled each other out the parties would agree not to call them as witnesses, to reduce the expense of litigation This happens occasionally, but not often, maybe because a lawyer who suggested that neither side should call expert witnesses would be understood to be signaling that the available experts on one side would actually be weaker than the opposing experts Note that if market or other incentives kept experts fully honest, defendants’ lawyers would often not introduce expert testimony at all, because they would ﬁnd it difﬁcult to locate a reputable expert who would contradict the plaintiff’s expert (Short and Sattler, 1996) So we should expect both sides in a lawsuit to present expert witnesses more often the “softer” the science related to the case Where the use of economic experts is most problematic is in the areas of economics in which there is no professional consensus This used to be, and to some extent still is, the situation with regard to antitrust economics A perfectly respectable economist might be an antitrust “hawk,” another equally respectable economist a “dove ” Each might have a long list of reputable academic publications fully consistent with systematically pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant testimony, and so a judge or jury would have little basis for choosing between them There might be 6 For examples of such difﬁculties in the area of employment discrimination, see Heckman (1998) and Follett, Ward and Welch (1993) 96 Journal of Economic Perspectives no available neutrals, in which event a court-appointed expert would perforce be a partisan A neglected cost of the use of economists to give testimony is the diversion of academic economists, especially those with tenure, from scholarly work to testifying Becoming an expert witness may pay an academic dividend, by giving an economist access to otherwise unavailable data But it is unlikely that the net output of academic economists (weighting quantity by quality) is greater as a result of their being in demand as expert witnesses The opportunity for extra income may of course draw able people into economics who would otherwise choose some other occupation, but this is a social gain only if their social product as economists is greater than it would be in the calling that they would otherwise follow—or if it enables universities to pay lower salaries to economists A further problem is that once an economist has a “track record” of successful testimony, that person may be reluctant to publish results of academic research that undermine the positions previously taken, or that were to be taken in the future, in the economist’s career as an expert witness If academic salaries were equal to the social marginal product of academics, the deﬂection of academics from academic research to testifying would not reduce social welfare But if academic research in economics produces social gains not captured by the researcher, and if that surplus is less than the surplus created by economists’ testifying, then the practice of hiring academic economists to testify does create a social cost (subject to the proviso in the previous paragraph concerning the social product of other occupations) This ignores, however, the possibility that the social beneﬁts of economic testimony exceed the social costs of a reduction in academic research To the extent that economic evidence increases the accuracy of trials, it enhances the deterrence of wrongful behavior The expected cost of punishment for some crime is the probability of punishment if one is guilty multiplied by the length of the sentence to be received if found guilty If justice is purely random, then the chance of being punished would be the same whether one was guilty or innocent—and there would be no deterrence 7 The more accurate the process of determining guilt is, the less random punishment will be, and the greater the probability that the guilty will be punished and the law-abiding will not, so the greater will be the law’s deterrent effect (Posner, 1973, p 412) To the extent that economic expert testimony does promote optimal deterrence, it confers an external beneﬁt that may be as great as the external beneﬁt generated by the expert’s academic research and teaching 7 In algebraic terms, the expected cost of punishment (EC) for some crime (or some unlawful act) is actually the difference between the expected cost of punishment if one commits the crime (ECg 5 pgS, where pg is the probability of punishment if the accused is guilty and S is the sentence) and the expected cost of punishment if one does not commit it (ECi 5 where pi is the probability of punishment if the accused is innocent and S is as before) Hence EC 5 pgS 2 piS equivalently, EC 5 ( pg 2 pi)S, making it transparent that if punishment is imposed randomly, so that the probability of punishment is the same regardless of guilt (that is, if pg 5 pi), the expected punishment cost for committing the crime will be zero Richard A Posner 97 Additional Proposals Supposing that economists’ testifying as expert witnesses is here to stay, we should consider how it might be improved My major proposal is the greater use of court-appointed experts selected on the arbitration model, but I have two additional proposals First, to make judicial criticism a more effective method of bringing reputation costs to bear on the errant expert, the American Economic Association (or a for-proﬁt ﬁrm that marketed the information to law ﬁrms) should maintain a roster of all testimonial appearances by members of the association The roster could contain an abstract of the member’s testimony (or, if the roster took the form of a web page on the World Wide Web, the entire testimony) and would also record any criticisms of the testimony by the judge or by the lawyers or experts on the other side of the lawsuit Then, the profession could monitor its members’ adherence to high standards of probity and care in their testimonial activities It may be objected that this project is to one side of the AEA’s main mission, which is to support economic research and teaching But the AEA purports to represent the economics profession as a whole many of its members are not academics shoddy economic testimony can impair the reputation of the profession as a whole and to the extent that testifying diverts economists from research and teaching, and may even distort those activities, the maintenance of high standards in economic testifying supports the research and teaching functions Second, lawyers who call an economic expert as a witness should be required to disclose the name of all the economists whom they contacted as possible witnesses This will alert the jury to the problem of “witness shopping ” Suppose that the lawyer for the plaintiff hired the ﬁrst economist whom he interviewed and the lawyer for the defendant hired the 20th economist whom she interviewed The inference is that the defendant’s economic case is weaker than the plaintiff’s The parallel is to conducting 20 statistical tests of a hypothesis and reporting, as signiﬁcant at the 5 percent level, the only one that supported the hypothesis y I thank Brad De Long, Thomas Ireland, Alan Krueger, William Landes, Tomas Philipson, and Timothy Taylor for very helpful comments on a previous draft 98

Court of the United States has addressed the validity of punitive damages awards many times over the years, but until now has never overturned one based on a claim of excessiveness under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment BMW of North America, Inc v Gore1 is the first case in which the Court reversed and remanded a large punitive damage amount based on those grounds I FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY In BMW of North America, Inc v Gore, the United States Supreme Court applied a three-part test to identify a punitive damage award that violated the Due Process Clause2 of the Fourteenth Amendment 3 The controversy in Gore began when Dr Ira Gore purchased a new sedan from the local authorized BMW dealer in Birmingham, Alabama 4 Nine months after the purchase, an independent car dealer informed Dr Gore that the car had been repainted prior to his purchase ' Gore brought suit against BMW of North America (\"BMW\") and the American distributor of BMW automobiles, claiming that the failure to disclose the car's condition constituted suppression of a material fact 6 1 116 S Ct 1589 (1996) 2 U S CONST amend XIV, § 1 which states \"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws \" Id 3 116 S Ct 1589 (1996) 4 Id at 1593 5 Id 6 Id 1273 MERCER LAW REVIEW Dr Gore's allegation was based on an Alabama statute7 that codified Alabama's common-law cause of action for fraud ' At trial, BMW acknowledged its policy of not disclosing to dealers any predelivery damages that were less than three percent of the suggested retail price 9 Apparently, the car had come into contact with acid rain on its transAtlantic trip from Germany \" The cost of repainting Dr Gore's car was only one and one-half percent of its value \" Dr Gore's complaint prayed for five hundred thousand dollars in compensatory damages, punitive damages, and costs 2 BMW argued that it was not obligated to report the repairs because they did not materially affect the car 13 BMW maintained that transactions in jurisdictions other than Alabama should not be used by the jury to assess the amount of damages to award 14 The jury found actual costs of four thousand dollars and then multiplied this by the approximate number of damaged cars sold in the United States 5 to arrive at the four million dollar punitive damage award ' In a post trial motion to deny the punitive award, BMW produced evidence that its nondisclosure policy was consistent with the laws of twenty-five states 17 None of those states required disclosure of repairs costing less than three percent of the suggested retail price ' The motion also indicated that BMW's policy had never been found unlawful before this action was filed 9 The trial judge held that the award was not excessive and denied the motion 2\" On appeal, the Alabama Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision 2' The court applied a combination of factors it had developed in prior cases and rejected BMW's claim that the award transcended 7 See ALA CODE § 6-5-102 (1993) See also ALA CODE § 4299 (1907) The statute provides, \"Suppression of a material fact which the party is under an obligation to communicate constitutes fraud The obligation to communicate may arise from the confidential relations of the parties or from the particular circumstances of the case \" Id 8 116 S Ct at

because it was based in part on incidents from other jurisdictions \" The court held that \"a reasonable punitive damages award in this case\" was two million dollars 24 The Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari and reversed the Alabama Supreme Court, holding that the two million dollar punitive damages award was grossly excessive, and therefore exceeded the constitutional limit 25 II LEGAL BACKGROUND The decision in Gore was the first one in which the United States Supreme Court expressly held a punitive damage award unconstitutional under the \"grossly excessive\" language in the Due Process Clause Prior to BMW, the Supreme Court, as well as the individual Justices, had expressed concern over the constitutionality of large punitive damage awards 2' The court had mentioned the due process analysis in recent opinions, but the Court always stopped short of reversing on \"grossly excessive\" grounds 2 7 For example, in Browning Ferris Industries of Vermont, Inc v Kelco Disposal, Inc ,25 petitioner sought due process protection based on the amount of the damages awarded However, the claim of excessiveness under the Due Process Clause had not been raised in either the district court or the court of appeals therefore, the Court put the inquiry off until another day ' In Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co v Haslip,0 the Court finally considered a

that would fit every case 2 The Court held that the punitive damages in question did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment 33 In reaching its conclusion, the Court analyzed the factors used in Green Oil Co v Hornsby,4 a case from the Supreme Court of Alabama The objective application of the Green Oil factors to the facts in Haslip allowed the Court to find \"a sufficiently definite and meaningful constraint on the discretion of the fact finders in awarding punitive damages \" 5 The Court reasoned that the Alabama Supreme Court's post-verdict review ensured that punitive damage awards were not grossly out of proportion to the severity of the offense and that the awards had some understandable relationship to compensatory damages 36 In a later case, TXO Production Corp v Alliance Resources Corp ,37 the Supreme Court again recognized that the Constitution imposes a substantive limit on the size of punitive awards The Court decided whether a particular punitive award was so \"grossly excessive\" as to violate the Due Process Clause 8 The Court upheld the award under its analysis of the objective factors announced in Haslip 39 The first case in which the Supreme Court actually reversed a punitive damage award was in Honda Motor Co v 'Oberg 4° In that case, the Court was \"not directly concerned with the character of a standard that will identify

judicial review of punitive awards 42 III THE SUPREME CouR's ANALYSIS The Supreme Court of the United States found the punitive damage award in Gore to be unconstitutional for two reasons 4 First, the award violated the Commerce Clause by restricting defendant's action in other states through the imposition of penalties in one state based on out-of-state actions 44 Second, the award was \"grossly excessive\" under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment 45 The Court reversed the decision of the Alabama Supreme Court because it found the punitive damage award to be \"grossly excessive\" in relation to the State's legitimate interest in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring repetition 46 The Court stated, \"[olnly when an award can fairly be categorized as 'grossly excessive' in relation to these interests does it enter the zone of arbitrariness that violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \"47 The Court identified Alabama's legitimate interests in punishing BMW,' and- then referred to Healy v Beer Institute,\"' where it had previously held that \"[pirinciples of state sovereignty and comity forbid a state to enact policies for the entire Nation, or impose its own policy choice on neighboring States \"0 The Court expressly stated that this type of imposition was a violation of the federal power over interstate commerce 1 The Court required Alabama to support its economic penalties by focusing on the interests of protecting its citizens and economy, not those of the Nation 2 The opinion centered on the notion of fairness that requires notice not only of the conduct that will subject a person to sanctions, but also of the severity of the punishment that a state may impose 53 41 Id at 420-21 42, Id 43 116 S Ct at

accepted the Alabama Supreme Court's interpretation of the jury verdict, but disagreed with respect to the amount imposed in the correction of the computation \"M Despite the fact that the United States Supreme Court had previously upheld the Green Oil factors that were the basis of the Alabama ruling in this case,\"5 the Court analyzed this situation under a different standard 56 The Court used three guideposts to find that BMW did not have any reasonable basis for believing that a two million dollar award could be the cost of not adhering to its nondisclosure policy, especially considering the policy was not in violation of any other state's laws 7 The first guidepost used to indicate a punitive damage award's excessiveness is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct 'M The Court reasoned that BMW's infliction of harm was purely economic in effect 6 9 There was no particularly malicious intention behind the action, and BMW made no deliberately false statements, acts of affirmative misconduct, or concealment of improper motive ' The second guidepost focused on the ratio between the compensatory damage and the punitive damage awards \"' The Court did not define an acceptable range, but found that the punitive award was five hundred times the compensatory award determined by the jury, and clearly outside of any acceptable range 62 The third guidepost consisted of a contrast between the punitive award and the civil or criminal sanctions that could be imposed under the particular state's laws 3 Alabama's fine for a similar action was two thousand dollarsf\" This was substantially smaller than the punitive award of two million 6\" This discussion also considered the possible categorization of BMW as a recidivist because of the previous suits filed by disgruntled customers \" This characterization was dispelled by the lack of notice put forth from any state statute 67 The Court briefly mentioned the lack of basis for

Court's decision resulted in a lack of protection from unconstitutional and arbitrary results, and thus the United States Supreme Court reversed 73 The dissenting opinions focused on what the Justices believed was an improper intrusion onto grounds appropriately left for state courts 7 The basis for these arguments came from the skeptical view of the Court's intrusion into this established area of

Guidelines outline the principal analytical techniques, practices, and enforcement policies of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (the “Agencies”) with respect to a range of transactions often described as vertical mergers and acquisitions 1 The relevant statutory provisions include Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U S C § 18, Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U S C §§ 1–2, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U S C § 45 Most particularly, Section 7 of the Clayton Act prohibits any merger or acquisition if, “in any line of commerce or in any activity affecting commerce in any section of the country, the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly ” This provision applies to vertical mergers, as Congress made plain in the 1950 amendments to the Clayton Act These Guidelines describe how the agencies analyze a range of non-horizontal transactions Where they use the term “vertical,” that term should not be read to narrow the applicability of these Guidelines The analytical techniques, practices, and enforcement policies described in these Guidelines apply to strictly vertical mergers (those that combine firms or assets at different stages of the same supply chain), “diagonal” mergers (those that combine firms or assets at different stages of competing supply chains), and vertical issues that can arise in mergers of complements In describing a vertical relationship, a stage closer to final consumers (such as a distributor, retailer, or finished goods manufacturer) is termed “downstream,” and a stage further from final consumers (such as a supplier, wholesaler, or input manufacturer) is termed “upstream ” Mergers often present both horizontal and vertical elements, and the Agencies may apply both the Horizontal Merger Guidelines2 and the Vertical Merger Guidelines in their evaluation of a transaction In addition, if one of the parties to a transaction could use its pre-existing operations to facilitate entry into the other’s market, the Agencies may consider whether the merger removes competition from a potential entrant, using the methods described in the Horizontal Merger Guidelines These Guidelines are intended to assist the business community and antitrust practitioners by increasing the transparency of the analytical process underlying the Agencies’ enforcement 1 These Guidelines supersede the extant portions of the Department of Justice’s 1984 Merger Guidelines, which are now withdrawn and superseded in their entirety They reflect the ongoing accumulation of experience at the Agencies These Guidelines may be revised from time to time as necessary to reflect significant changes in enforcement policy, to clarify existing policy, or to reflect new learning 2 U S Dep’t of Justice Fed Trade Comm’n, Horizontal Merger Guidelines (2010) 1                                                                                                                              decisions They may also assist the courts in developing an appropriate framework for interpreting and applying the antitrust laws to the types of transactions discussed herein 3 These Guidelines should be read in conjunction with the Horizontal Merger Guidelines Many of the principles and analytic frameworks used to assess horizontal mergers apply to vertical mergers For example, Section 1 of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines—describing in general terms the purposes and limitations of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines and the goals of merger enforcement—is also relevant to the consideration of vertical mergers Other topics addressed in the Horizontal Merger Guidelines, but not addressed herein – such as the analytic framework for evaluating entry considerations, the treatment of the acquisition of a failing firm or its assets, and the acquisition of a partial ownership interest – are relevant to the evaluation of the competitive effects of vertical mergers as well Vertical mergers, however, also raise distinct considerations, which these Guidelines address For example, vertical mergers often benefit consumers through the elimination of double marginalization, which tends to lessen the risks of competitive harm While the agencies more often encounter problematic horizontal mergers than problematic vertical mergers, vertical mergers are not invariably innocuous These Guidelines describe the framework applied by the Agencies in distinguishing anticompetitive from procompetitive (and competitively neutral) vertical mergers As with horizontal mergers, the Agencies normally examine effects on the actual and potential direct customers of the merging parties, and, if different, the final consumers of firms that utilize the goods or services of the merging parties The Agencies are concerned with harm to competition, not to competitors When a merger involves products at different levels of a supply chain, the direct customers the Agencies will consider are actual and potential buyers of the downstream products Absent convincing evidence to the contrary, the Agencies presume that adverse effects on these direct customers lead to adverse effects on final consumers The enhancement of market power by buyers, sometimes called “monopsony power,” has adverse effects comparable to the enhancement of market power by sellers The Agencies employ an analogous framework to analyze vertical mergers that may enhance the market power of buyers  In evaluating effects, the Agencies focus on the likely changes in competitive outcomes caused by a merger Therefore, the Agencies focus on competitive outcomes caused by conduct that would be compatible with firms’ abilities and incentives following a vertical merger, but would not be in the absence of the merger To the extent practicable, the Agencies use a consistent set of facts and assumptions to evaluate both the potential competitive harm from a vertical merger and the potential benefits to competition 3 These Guidelines are not intended to describe how the Agencies will conduct the litigation of cases they decide to bring Although relevant in that context, these Guidelines neither dictate nor exhaust the range of evidence the Agencies may introduce in litigation 2                                                                                                                  2 EVIDENCE OF ADVERSE COMPETITIVE EFFECTS The Agencies consider any reasonably available and reliable evidence to address the central question of whether a vertical merger may substantially lessen competition The types of evidence described in Section 2 1 of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines can also be informative about the effects of vertical mergers, including actual effects observed in consummated mergers, direct comparisons based on experience, and evidence about the disruptive role of a merging party The Agencies may also consider evidence about the disruptive role of non-merging firms – for example, when evaluating a theory that a vertical merger may allow the merged firm to discipline disruptive rivals The Agencies may also consider market shares and concentration in relevant markets (see Section 3), and may rely on evidence of head-to-head competition between one merging firm and rivals that trade with the other merging firm when evaluating unilateral effects (see Section 4) The sources of evidence on which the Agencies rely are the same as those set forth in Section 2 2 of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines and include documents and statements of the merging parties, their customers, and other industry participants and observers 3 MARKET DEFINITION, RELATED PRODUCTS, MARKET SHARES, AND CONCENTRATION In any merger enforcement action involving a vertical merger, the Agencies will normally identify one or more relevant markets in which the merger may substantially lessen competition Many of the general purposes and limitations of market definition described in Section 4 of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines are also relevant when the Agencies define markets for vertical mergers, and the Agencies generally use the methodology set forth in Sections 4 1 and 4 2 of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines to define relevant markets for vertical mergers When the Agencies identify a potential competitive concern in a relevant market, they will also specify one or more related products A related product is a product or service that is supplied or controlled by the merged firm and is positioned vertically or is complementary to the products and services in the relevant market For example, a related product could be an input, a means of distribution, access to a set of customers, or a complement The same transaction can give rise to more than one vertical concern, and different concerns may affect different relevant markets Example 1 Relevant markets can be upstream or downstream Situation A retail chain buys the manufacturer of Brand A cleaning products Discussion In this example, the merged firm’s supply of Brand A cleaning products (the related product) could affect downstream competition between retailers in a given geographic area (the relevant market) The Agencies may also consider whether the merged firm’s retailing of cleaning products in a given geographic area (the related product) could affect competition between manufacturers of cleaning products in that area (the relevant market) The Agencies may consider measures of market shares and market concentration in a relevant market in their evaluation of competitive effects The Agencies evaluate market shares and 3                                                                                                                     concentration in conjunction with other reasonably available and reliable evidence for the ultimate purpose of determining whether a merger may substantially lessen competition The Agencies use the methodology set out in Section 5 of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines to measure shares and concentration in a relevant market, but do not rely on the thresholds in Section 5 3 as screens for or indicators of competitive effects from vertical theories of harm Existing levels of concentration may nonetheless be relevant For example, high concentration in the relevant market may provide evidence about the likelihood, durability, or scope of anticompetitive effects in that relevant market 4 UNILATERAL EFFECTS A vertical merger may diminish competition between one merging firm and rivals that trade with, or could trade with, the other merging firm This section discusses common types of unilateral effects arising from vertical mergers Section (a) discusses foreclosure and raising rivals’ costs Section (b) discusses competitively sensitive information These effects do not exhaust the types of possible unilateral effects a Foreclosure and Raising Rivals’ Costs A vertical merger may diminish competition by allowing the merged firm to profitably use its control of the related product to weaken or remove the competitive constraint from one or more of its actual or potential rivals in the relevant market For example, a merger may increase the vertically integrated firm’s incentive or ability to raise its rivals’ costs by increasing the price or lowering the quality of the related product The merged firm could also refuse to supply rivals with the related products altogether (“foreclosure”) In identifying whether a vertical merger may diminish competition due to unilateral foreclosure or raising rivals’ costs,4 the Agencies generally consider whether the following conditions are satisfied (1) Ability By altering the terms by which it provides a related product to one or more of its rivals, the merged firm would likely be able to cause those rivals (a) to lose significant sales in the relevant market (for example, if they are forced out of the market if they are deterred from innovation, entry, or expansion, or cannot finance those activities or if they have incentives to pass on higher costs through higher prices) or (b) to otherwise compete less aggressively for customers’ business 4 For ease of exposition, the principal discussion is about input foreclosure and raising rivals’ input costs following a merger between vertically related firms, where the concern is that the merged firm could profitably use its supply of an input (the related product) to weaken the competitive constraint it faces from rivals in the downstream market (the relevant market) Examples in this section discuss the analogous analysis for foreclosure or raising rivals’ costs that raise barriers to entry, customer foreclosure and raising rivals’ distribution costs, and mergers of complements 4                                                                                                                                           This element would not be satisfied, and in turn a merger would rarely warrant close scrutiny for its potential to lead to foreclosure or raising rivals’ costs, if rivals could readily switch purchases to alternatives to the related product, including self-supply, without any meaningful effect on the price, quality, or availability of products or services in the relevant market The Agencies’ review of the merged firm’s rivals’ ability to switch to alternatives to the related product may include, but is not limited to, the types of evidence the Agencies use to evaluate customer switching when implementing the hypothetical monopolist test, listed in Section 4 1 3 of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines (2) Incentive The merged firm, as a result of the merger, would likely find it profitable to foreclose rivals, or offer inferior terms for the related product, because it benefits significantly in the relevant market when rivals lose sales or alter their behavior in response to the foreclosure or to the inferior terms This element would not be satisfied, and in turn a merger would rarely warrant close scrutiny for its potential to induce foreclosure or raise rivals’ costs, if the merged firm would not benefit from a reduction in actual or potential competition with users of the related product in the relevant market The Agencies’ assessment of the effect of a vertical merger on the incentive to foreclose rivals or raise their costs by changing the terms of the related product will be fact-specific For example, in the case of foreclosure, the Agencies generally consider whether the merged firm’s gains in the relevant market would likely outweigh any losses from reduced sales of the related product Mergers for which these conditions are met potentially raise significant competitive concerns and often warrant scrutiny For mergers that warrant scrutiny, the Agencies will determine whether, based on an evaluation of the facts and circumstances of the relevant market, the merger may substantially lessen competition This evaluation will generally include an assessment of the likely net effect on competition in the relevant market of all changes to the merged firm’s unilateral incentives The merged firm may foreclose its rivals or raise their costs by changing the terms offered for the related product, but a vertical merger can also change other incentives The elimination of double marginalization, for example, can confer on the merged firm an incentive to set lower downstream prices The price that a downstream firm pays for an input supplied by an independent upstream firm may include a markup over the upstream firm’s marginal cost If a downstream and an upstream firm merge, and the merged firm supplies itself with its own related product, it will have access to the input at cost (See Section 6 ) The likely merger-induced increase or decrease in downstream prices would be determined by considering the impact of both these effects, as well as any other competitive effects To the extent practicable and appropriate, the Agencies will use the same set of facts and assumptions to evaluate both the potential harm from a vertical merger and the potential benefits of the elimination of double marginalization, and will focus on evaluating conduct that would be most profitable for the merged firm as a whole 5                                                                                                                                          Where sufficient relevant data are available, the Agencies may construct economic models designed to quantify the net effect on competition The Agencies may employ merger simulation models to assist in this quantitative evaluation These models often include independent price responses by non-merging firms and may incorporate feedback from the different effects on incentives The Agencies do not treat merger simulation evidence as conclusive in itself, and they place more weight on whether merger simulations using reasonable models consistently predict substantial price increases than on the precise prediction of any single simulation The Agencies may also determine that a merger may substantially lessen competition based on an evaluation of qualitative evidence of all potential effects The next paragraphs provide illustrative examples of the application of this general framework The examples do not exhaust the types of possible foreclosure concerns Example 2 Input foreclosure and raising rivals’ costs Situation Upstream firms supply oranges to downstream firms, which use the oranges to produce orange juice All orange suppliers make take-it-or-leave-it offers to sell at constant unit prices 5 A supplier of oranges (the related product) merges with a producer of orange juice (the relevant market) that buys its entire orange demand from the supplier Discussion The merged firm may have the ability to restrict the supply of oranges to rival orange juice producers If those rivals lack alternative sources of oranges to those of the merged firm in sufficient quantity at comparable price and quality, the merged firm may be able to increase their costs by raising the price at which it sells them oranges or by refusing to sell them oranges altogether The Agencies may assess whether the merged firm would likely have an incentive to raise the price at which it supplies oranges to rivals This assessment may focus on the resulting reduction in competition, including any reduction due to the diversion of sales of orange juice to the merged firm Capturing the downstream margin on the diverted sales through merger may make a price increase profitable, even though the price increase would not be profitable for the orange supplier absent the merger The effect on the price the merged firm charges for oranges depends on the merged firm’s gains from diverted sales in the relevant market and from increased prices in the relevant market The Agencies may also consider whether the merged firm may have an incentive to stop supplying oranges to rival orange juice producers altogether In doing so, the merged firm would lose the margin on the forgone sales of oranges, but may benefit from a higher margin and increased sales of orange juice diverted from its rivals If the benefits from 5 By “constant unit prices,” we refer to a simple linear price per-unit with no other fees or offsets The pricing structure is relevant to the likelihood and the degree of both raising rivals’ costs and the elimination of double marginalization 6                                                                                                                   increased downstream sales outweigh the costs of the forgone upstream sales, the merged firm may find it profitable to foreclose In either case, the merged firm will likely source its oranges at reduced cost rather than paying a price that includes a margin to an independent firm, giving it an incentive to set lower prices on its own orange juice products (the effects of eliminating double marginalization) To determine whether the merger may substantially lessen competition, the Agencies would analyze the specific facts and circumstances, including in particular the relative magnitude of these offsetting incentives Example 3 Raising the input costs of rivals with bargaining Situation A firm supplies Product A to a number of competing downstream retailers, each of which would lose significant business overall if it did not stock Product A Terms are set through bargaining, and contracts take the form of constant unit wholesale prices The supplier of Product A merges with one of the retailers Discussion The vertical merger may diminish competition between retailers (the relevant market) by giving the merged firm the leverage to raise its rivals’ costs by negotiating increased wholesale prices for the firm’s supply of Product A (the related product) from its rival retailers Compared to the manufacturer of Product A acting independently, the merged firm may benefit downstream if it refuses to supply one or more of its downstream rivals and if such rivals lose sales as a result This benefit improves the merged firm’s alternative to a supply agreement should negotiations take time to resolve, or fail altogether, and thus may increase the merged firm’s bargaining leverage with rival retailers Rivals that pay higher wholesale prices for Product A would likely set higher retail prices In contrast, the merged firm will likely lower its costs for sourcing Product A because it will not pay a wholesale price to a third party that includes a markup over cost, providing the merged firm with an incentive to lower its retail price for Product A It is a factual question whether competition in the retail market would be substantially lessened, such that consumers in the retail market would pay higher prices, on average, after the merger Example 4 Creating the need for two-level entry Situation Company A is the sole supplier of an active ingredient required to make an offpatent pharmaceutical drug produced only by Company B Company A’s supply of the active ingredient is the related product It sets a constant unit price Company C is considering entering the relevant market with its own version of the drug Were it to enter, head-to-head competition with Company B would be significant and prices for the drug would likely fall significantly, leading to increased sales Company B buys Company A In the absence of the merger, Company A would benefit from Company C’s entry 7                                                                                                                      Discussion The merger may diminish competition in the relevant market by making entry by Company C less likely In the absence of the merger, Company A would likely have an incentive to facilitate the entry of Company C and to supply Company C if it did enter The merged firm, on the other hand, may have the ability to prevent Company C from successfully entering the relevant market by refusing to supply Company C with any active ingredient In this case, Company C’s successful entry into the relevant market may require Company C to produce the active ingredient as well This two-level entry may be more costly and riskier than entering the relevant market alone, and thus may deter Company C from entering Moreover, the merged firm may have an incentive to refuse to supply Company C unless it is markedly more efficient or targeting additional customer groups or markets The Agencies would also consider the effects on competition if the merged firm would eliminate double marginalization by sourcing the active ingredient at cost rather than paying a price that included a markup The likely net effect on competition in the relevant market would depend, in part, on the extent to which entry was likely absent the merger Example 5 Raising rivals’ costs of distribution Situation A distributor of components to customize trucks for different uses offers competing liftgates for loading Liftgates are supplied at a constant unit wholesale price The distributor buys a manufacturer of liftgates The distributor has developed a strong position in Region X based on offering superior support and developing close customer relationships Many customers consider other distributors to be inadequate substitutes for the merged firm’s distribution of liftgates in Region X (the related product) Discussion The Agencies may consider whether the merger would harm competition in the market for the manufacture of liftgates in Region X (a relevant market) Because customers prefer the merged firm’s superior distribution service, the merged firm may be able to disadvantage manufacturers of rival liftgates by setting higher retail prices for their products The profitability of such a strategy would depend on diversion to the merged firm’s liftgates as well as sales lost to rival distributors A potential harm in this example is diminished competition between manufacturers of liftgates (a relevant market upstream from the market for the distribution of liftgates) The Agencies, however, may consider the impact on retail prices when evaluating the effects on competition in the relevant market The competitiveness of upstream manufacturers depends, in part, on the derived demand from customers of the downstream distributors, who choose among manufacturers’ products based on downstream retail prices Competition in the retail sale of liftgates may be harmed if the merged firm raises retail prices for rival brands, even though rival manufacturers may respond to the change in the merged firm’s incentives by setting lower, not higher, wholesale prices The Agencies would also evaluate the extent of the merged firm’s 8                                                                                                                           incentive to set a lower price for liftgates because of the elimination of double marginalization Example 6 Merger of complements raising vertical issues Situation Manufacturers use batteries and motors when making electric scooters Electric scooter manufacturers use different batteries and motors based on their production technologies The two components are complements manufacturers make more scooters, and demand more of both components, when the price of either component falls All components are sold under contracts that specify a constant unit price The leading maker of motors for scooters merges with a manufacturer of batteries for scooters Discussion Motors and batteries are complementary inputs into the production of electric scooters Neither input is upstream nor downstream from the other in the supply chain The Agencies may investigate whether the merged firm would have the ability and incentive to disadvantage rival manufacturers of batteries For example, the merged firm might do so by increasing the price of its motors (the related product) to its customers (e g , electric scooter manufacturers) that do not also buy the merged firm’s batteries The merged firm may also have an incentive to offer lower prices for batteries to its customers that do buy both components from it If the Agencies conclude that both countervailing price effects are likely to be present post-merger, the Agencies will conduct a balancing of the effects to determine the net effect on the prices customers will likely pay The Agencies may also use an analysis similar to the above to investigate whether the merged firm would have the ability and incentive to disadvantage rival manufacturers of motors (in an additional relevant market) by increasing the price of batteries (the related product) to its customers that do not also buy the merged firm’s motors Example 7 Diagonal merger Situation An electronics firm develops a component that enhances the wireless capability of low-end laptop computers This component intensifies competition between low-end laptop computers that incorporate the component as an input and high-end laptop computers that already provide premium wireless capabilities without the component The largest manufacturer of high-end laptop computers with premium wireless capability acquires this electronics firm The acquisition neither expands nor improves the functionality that the acquiring firm can provide The acquired technology is not compatible with the acquiring firm’s products, and redesigning its products to incorporate the acquired technology would neither lower its marginal costs nor improve the wireless capabilities of its laptops Discussion The Agencies may investigate whether the merged firm would have the ability and incentive to reduce competition in the market for laptop computers (a relevant market) by increasing the price, degrading the quality, or reducing the availability of the 9                                                                                                                     component providing wireless capability (the related product) The incompatibility between the technologies of the merging firms strongly suggests that this merger is unlikely to generate any benefits due to the elimination of double marginalization b Access to Competitively Sensitive Information In a vertical merger, the transaction may give the combined firm access to and control of sensitive business information about its upstream or downstream rivals that was unavailable to it before the merger For example, a downstream rival to the merged firm may have been a premerger customer of the upstream firm Post-merger, the downstream component of the merged firm could now have access to its rival’s sensitive business information In some circumstances, the merged firm can use access to a rival’s competitively sensitive information to moderate its competitive response to its rival’s competitive actions For example, it may preempt or react quickly to a rival’s procompetitive business actions Under such conditions, rivals may see less competitive value in taking procompetitive actions Relatedly, rivals may refrain from doing business with the merged firm rather than risk that the merged firm would use their competitively sensitive business information as described above They may become less effective competitors if they must rely on less preferred trading partners, or if they pay higher prices because they have fewer competing options 5 COORDINATED EFFECTS In some cases, a vertical merger may diminish competition by enabling or encouraging postmerger coordinated interaction among firms in the relevant market that harms customers Section 7 of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines describes how the Agencies evaluate coordinated effects In particular, Section 7 1 notes that the Agencies are more likely to challenge a merger on the basis of coordinated effects when the relevant market shows signs of vulnerability to coordinated conduct, and the Agencies have a credible basis on which to conclude that the merger may enhance that vulnerability Section 7 2 sets forth evidence relevant to evaluating whether a market is vulnerable to coordination The theories of harm discussed in the Horizontal Merger Guidelines, as well as those discussed below, are not exhaustive, but rather are illustrations of the manner in which a merger may lessen competition due to coordinated effects A vertical merger may enhance the market’s vulnerability to coordination by eliminating or hindering a maverick firm that otherwise plays or would play an important role in preventing or limiting anticompetitive coordination in the relevant market For example, the merged firm could use its control over a related product or service to harm the ability of a non-merging maverick to compete in the relevant market, thereby increasing the likelihood of coordinated interaction among the merged firm and rivals participating in that market Coordinated effects may also arise in other ways, including when changes in market structure or the merged firm’s access to confidential information facilitate (a) reaching a tacit agreement among market participants, (b) detecting cheating on such an agreement, or (c) punishing cheating firms 10                                                                                                                                   Example 8 Vertical merger raising coordinated effects issues Situation A merger combines a manufacturer of components and a maker of final products Discussion Where the component manufacturer supplies rival makers of final products, it will have information on the rival’s volume of final product, and thus will be better able to detect cheating on a tacit agreement to limit the output of final products As a result, the merger may make an agreement to limit supply more effective Some effects of a vertical merger may make the market less vulnerable to coordination For example, a vertical merger’s elimination of double marginalization (see Section 6) may increase the merged firm’s incentive to cheat on a tacit agreement, thereby reducing the risk of coordinated effects 6 PROCOMPETITIVE EFFECTS Vertical mergers combine complementary economic functions and eliminate contracting frictions, and therefore have the capacity to create a range of potentially cognizable efficiencies that benefit competition and consumers Vertical mergers combine complementary assets, including those used at different levels in the supply chain, to make a final product A single firm able to coordinate how these assets are used may be able to streamline production, inventory management, or distribution It may also be able to create innovative products in ways that would not likely be achieved through arm’s-length contracts The Agencies evaluate efficiency claims by the parties using the approach set forth in Section 10 of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines, as elaborated here Cognizable efficiencies are mergerspecific efficiencies that have been verified and do not arise from anticompetitive reductions in output or service The Agencies do not challenge a merger if cognizable efficiencies are of a character and magnitude such that the merger is unlikely to be anticompetitive in any relevant market 6 Due to the elimination of double marginalization, mergers of vertically related firms will often result in the merged firm’s incurring lower costs for the upstream input than the downstream firm would have paid absent the merger This is because the merged firm will have access to the upstream input at cost, whereas often the downstream firm would have paid a price that included a markup The elimination of double marginalization is not a production, research and development, or procurement efficiency it arises directly from the alignment of economic incentives between the merging firms Since the same source drives any incentive to foreclose or raise rivals’ costs, the evidence needed to assess those competitive harms overlaps substantially with that needed to evaluate the procompetitive benefits likely to result from the elimination of double marginalization 6 The Agencies in their prosecutorial discretion may also consider efficiencies that are not strictly in the relevant market, using the principles set out in footnote 14 of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines 11                                                                                                             Mergers of firms that make complementary products can lead to a pricing efficiency analogous to the elimination of double marginalization Absent the merger, the merging parties would set the price for each complement without regard to the impact of lower prices for one on demand for the other If the two merge, the merged firm has an incentive to set prices that maximize the profits of the firm as a whole, which may result in lower prices for each component Any incentive to offer lower prices may be more pronounced if the merged firm can target lower prices at customers that buy both components from it While it is incumbent upon the merging firms to provide substantiation for claims that they will benefit from the elimination of double marginalization, the Agencies may independently attempt to quantify its effect based on all available evidence, including the evidence they develop to assess the potential for foreclosure or raising rivals’ costs In verifying the elimination of double marginalization, the agencies typically examine the likely cost saving to the merged firm from self-supplying inputs that would have been purchased from independent suppliers absent the merger Creditable quantifications of the elimination of double marginalization are generally of similar precision and reliability to the Agencies’ quantifications of likely foreclosure, raising rivals’ costs, or other competitive effects In assessing the merger-specificity of the elimination of double marginalization, the Agencies typically examine whether it would likely be less costly for the merged firm to self-supply inputs following the merger than for the downstream firm to purchase them from one or more independent firms absent the merger The merging parties’ evidence about existing contracting practices is often the best evidence of the price the downstream firm would likely pay for inputs absent the merger The Agencies also consider other evidence, such as contracts between similarly situated firms in the same industry and contracting efforts considered by the merging firms The Agencies do not, however, reject the merger specificity of the elimination of double marginalization solely because it could theoretically be achieved but for the merger, if such practices are not reflected in documentary evidence The Agencies will generally take the same approach to evaluate the likely contractual arrangements absent the transaction as the one they use when evaluating raising rivals’ costs or foreclosure The Agencies’ assessment of the effects of the elimination of double marginalization on competition in the relevant markets relative to unilateral and coordinated effects
