# super-search
 Semantic indexing tool for PDF repositories

# Motivation
This project is motivated by existing text searching tools like Agent Ransack (FileLocator), which can quickly keyword search through thousands of files 

## To-Do List:
- ~~Use PyMuPDF for faster file reads~~
- ~~Add support for text file reading~~
- ~~Implement custom chunking algorithm~~
- ~~Switch to approximate NN search (pynndescent) for fast queries~~
- Add BM25 search as a complement to semantic search (in progress)
- Test multiprocessing for faster PDF reads (in progress)
- Add a GUI
- Create Windows executable
